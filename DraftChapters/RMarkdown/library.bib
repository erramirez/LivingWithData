abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate two potential methods for increasing participant compliance with behavioral self-monitoring (BSM). DESIGN: A randomized 2 × 2 factorial design was used to evaluate the effects of target behavior choice (choice vs. assigned) and self-management skills training (training vs. no-training) on BSM compliance. In the choice manipulation, participants either chose or were assigned one of seven types of healthful or safe behaviors to self-monitor. In the training manipulation, participants either completed computer-based self-management skills training or received no training. Participants were then asked to complete daily BSM for 2 weeks. SETTING: The study was conducted at a university and teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: Participants (N=60) were predominantly university and hospital employees. MEASURES: The primary dependent measure was percent compliance with BSM. ANALYSIS: A factorial analysis of variance of compliance scores was performed. RESULTS: Mean compliance with prescribed BSM was 52.6{\%} (SD=31.8). The main effect for choice was significant, with choice participants showing 18{\%} higher BSM compliance than those in no-choice conditions (d=.59; p<.05). The effects of self-management skills training and the interaction term were both nonsignificant. CONCLUSION: Although self-management skills training did not appear to affect BSM compliance, offering individuals a choice in target behavior substantially increased both BSM compliance and self-reported behavior change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Television (TV) viewing is a highly prevalent sedentary behavior in young people and has played a significant role in the assessment of sedentary behaviors. An important question to be addressed is to what extent TV viewing is a suitable indicator, or marker, of overall levels of sedentary behavior in children and adolescents. This has not yet been attempted in youth, but has already been attempted in Australian adults. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to test whether TV viewing in UK teenagers is a marker of sedentary behavior more broadly and to see if the results mirror those of Australian adults. METHODS: Ecological momentary assessment time-use diaries were completed by 561 boys and 923 girls (mean age 14.67 years) in which weekday and weekend out-of-school time behaviors were recorded every 15 min. RESULTS: TV viewing was negatively associated with other leisure-time sedentary behaviors for both boys and girls for weekdays and weekends. Higher levels of TV viewing were associated with less time in other key sedentary behaviors, such as computer use in boys and motorized transport in girls. CONCLUSIONS: TV viewing appears not to reflect additional time in other sedentary behaviors in British teenagers, in contrast to data from Australian women. Studies of sedentary behavior should encompass as wide a range of behaviors as possible.},

abstract = {Local parks and walkable neighborhoods are commonly cited as elements of the urban environment that promote physical activity and reduce obesity risk. When those vulnerable to obesity-related diseases live in neighborhoods without these qualities, it works against environmental justice goals that aim for a fair distribution of amenities. We use geographic information systems (GIS) to evaluate the relationship between the distribution of populations vulnerable to obesity and proximity to parks and walkable street networks in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Though previous studies have used GIS to assess the distribution of access to opportunities for physical activity, none have analyzed access to both parks and walkable resources at once. Neither have they included data that reflects findings on a smaller scale indicating that perceptions of resource quality, safety, and cultural relevance also affect physical activity levels. We include these safety and quality factors in our study through statistical data on traffic fatalities, crime rates and park size. We find that, counter to predictions, subpopulations generally considered vulnerable to obesity (and environmental injustices more generally) are more likely to live in walkable neighborhoods and have better walking access to neighborhood parks than other groups in Phoenix. However, crime is highest in walkable neighborhoods with large Latino/a and African-American populations and parks are smaller in areas populated by Latino/as. Given the higher prevalence of obesity and related diseases in lower income and minority populations in Phoenix, the results suggest that benefits of built environments may be offset by social characteristics. Our most consistent finding indicates a strong negative relationship between the percentage of the population under 18 years of age living in an area and the likelihood that the structure of the built environment supports physical activity. Children under 18 are significantly underrepresented in regions deemed highly walkable and those with access to parks.},

abstract = {School-based interventions are encouraged to support youth physical activity (PA). Classroom-based PA has been incorporated as one component of school wellness policies. The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the effects of integrating PA with mathematics content on math class and school day PA levels of elementary students. Participants include four teachers and 75 students. Five math classes are taught without PA integration (i.e., baseline) followed by 13 math classes that integrate PA. Students wear pedometers and accelerometers to track PA during math class and throughout the school day. Students perform significantly more PA on school days and in math classes during the intervention. In addition, students perform higher intensity (step min(-1)) PA during PA integration math classes compared with baseline math classes. Integrating PA into the classroom is an effective alternative approach to improving PA levels among youth and is an important component of school-based wellness policies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consumer-wearable activity trackers are electronic devices used for monitoring fitness- and other health-related metrics. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence for validity and reliability of popular consumer-wearable activity trackers (Fitbit and Jawbone) and their ability to estimate steps, distance, physical activity, energy expenditure, and sleep.

METHODS: Searches included only full-length English language studies published in PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar through July 31, 2015. Two people reviewed and abstracted each included study.

RESULTS: In total, 22 studies were included in the review (20 on adults, 2 on youth). For laboratory-based studies using step counting or accelerometer steps, the correlation with tracker-assessed steps was high for both Fitbit and Jawbone (Pearson or intraclass correlation coefficients (CC) > =0.80). Only one study assessed distance for the Fitbit, finding an over-estimate at slower speeds and under-estimate at faster speeds. Two field-based studies compared accelerometry-assessed physical activity to the trackers, with one study finding higher correlation (Spearman CC 0.86, Fitbit) while another study found a wide range in correlation (intraclass CC 0.36-0.70, Fitbit and Jawbone). Using several different comparison measures (indirect and direct calorimetry, accelerometry, self-report), energy expenditure was more often under-estimated by either tracker. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were over-estimated and wake after sleep onset was under-estimated comparing metrics from polysomnography to either tracker using a normal mode setting. No studies of intradevice reliability were found. Interdevice reliability was reported on seven studies using the Fitbit, but none for the Jawbone. Walking- and running-based Fitbit trials indicated consistently high interdevice reliability for steps (Pearson and intraclass CC 0.76-1.00), distance (intraclass CC 0.90-0.99), and energy expenditure (Pearson and intraclass CC 0.71-0.97). When wearing two Fitbits while sleeping, consistency between the devices was high.

CONCLUSION: This systematic review indicated higher validity of steps, few studies on distance and physical activity, and lower validity for energy expenditure and sleep. The evidence reviewed indicated high interdevice reliability for steps, distance, energy expenditure, and sleep for certain Fitbit models. As new activity trackers and features are introduced to the market, documentation of the measurement properties can guide their use in research settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in developed countries. Sedentary screen-based activities such as video gaming are thought to displace active behaviors and are independently associated with obesity. Active video games, where players physically interact with images onscreen, may have utility as a novel intervention to increase physical activity and improve body composition in children. The aim of the Electronic Games to Aid Motivation to Exercise (eGAME) study is to determine the effects of an active video game intervention over 6 months on: body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, waist circumference, cardio-respiratory fitness, and physical activity levels in overweight children. METHODS/DESIGN: Three hundred and thirty participants aged 10-14 years will be randomized to receive either an active video game upgrade package or to a control group (no intervention). DISCUSSION: An overview of the eGAME study is presented, providing an example of a large, pragmatic randomized controlled trial in a community setting. Reflection is offered on key issues encountered during the course of the study. In particular, investigation into the feasibility of the proposed intervention, as well as robust testing of proposed study procedures is a critical step prior to implementation of a large-scale trial.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is an impending epidemic. This article is an overview of different interventions conducted in school settings so as to guide efforts for an effective management of obesity in children, thus minimizing the risk of adult obesity and related cardiovascular risk. METHODS: PubMed and OVID Medline databases were searched for school-based obesity interventions with anthropometric measures in children and adolescents between the ages of 7 and 19 years from June 1986 to June 2006. Studies were reviewed by duration, type of intervention, and defined qualitative and quantitative measures, resulting in a yield of 51 intervention studies. RESULTS: The interventions ranged from 4 weeks in length to as long as 8 continuing years. In total, 15 of the intervention studies exclusively utilized physical activity programs, 16 studies exclusively utilized educational models and behavior modification strategies, and 20 studies utilized both. In addition, 31 studies utilized exclusively quantitative variables like body mass indices and waist-to-hip ratios to measure the efficacy of the intervention programs, and another 20 studies utilized a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures that included self-reported physical activity and attitude toward physical activity and the tested knowledge of nutrition, cardiovascular health, and physical fitness. A total of 40 studies achieved positive statistically significant results between the baseline and the follow-up quantitative measurements. CONCLUSIONS: No persistence of positive results in reducing obesity in school-age children has been observed. Studies employing long-term follow-up of quantitative and qualitative measurements of short-term interventions in particular are warranted.},

abstract = {A cross-sectional study targeted a total of 43,630 pupils in Niigata City, Japan was performed. The objective was to clarify the present incidence of low back pain (LBP) in childhood and adolescence in Japan. It has recently been recognized that LBP in childhood and adolescence is also as common a problem as that for adults and most of these studies have been conducted in Europe, however, none have so far been made in Japan. A questionnaire survey was conducted using 43,630 pupils, including all elementary school students from the fourth to sixth grade (21,893 pupils) and all junior high students from the first to third year (21,737 pupils) in Niigata City (population of 785,067) to examine the point prevalence of LBP, the lifetime prevalence, the gender differences, the age of first onset of LBP in third year of junior high school students, the duration, the presence of recurrent LBP or not, the trigger of LBP, and the influences of sports and physical activities. In addition, the severity of LBP was divided into three levels (level 1: no limitation in any activity; level 2: necessary to refrain from participating in sports and physical activities, and level 3: necessary to be absent from school) in order to examine the factors that contribute to severe LBP. The validity rate was 79.8{\%} and the valid response rate was 98.8{\%}. The point prevalence was 10.2{\%} (52.3{\%} male and 47.7{\%} female) and the lifetime prevalence was 28.8{\%} (48.5{\%} male and 51.5{\%} female). Both increased as the grade level increased and in third year of junior high school students, a point prevalence was seen in 15.2{\%} while a lifetime prevalence was observed in 42.5{\%}. About 90{\%} of these students experienced first-time LBP during the first and third year of junior high school. Regarding the duration of LBP, 66.7{\%} experienced it for less than 1 week, while 86.1{\%} suffered from it for less than 1 month. The recurrence rate was 60.5{\%}. Regarding the triggers of LBP, 23.7{\%} of them reported the influence of sports and exercise such as club activities and physical education, 13.5{\%} reported trauma, while 55.6{\%} reported no specific triggers associated with their LBP. The severity of LBP included 81.9{\%} at level 1, 13.9{\%} at level 2 and 4.2{\%} at level 3. It was revealed that LBP in childhood and adolescence is also a common complaint in Japan, and these findings are similar to previous studies conducted in Europe. LBP increased as the grade level increased and it appeared that the point and lifetime prevalence in adolescence are close to the same levels as those seen in the adulthood and there was a tendency to have more severe LBP in both cases who experienced pain for more than 1 month and those with recurrent LBP.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults in the United States has increased over several decades. OBJECTIVE: To provide current estimates of the prevalence and trends of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of height and weight measurements from 3958 children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years and 4431 adults aged 20 years or older obtained in 2003-2004 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 1999-2000 and in 2001-2002 were compared with data from 2003-2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimates of the prevalence of overweight in children and adolescents and obesity in adults. Overweight among children and adolescents was defined as at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for age growth charts. Obesity among adults was defined as a BMI of 30 or higher; extreme obesity was defined as a BMI of 40 or higher. RESULTS: In 2003-2004, 17.1{\%} of US children and adolescents were overweight and 32.2{\%} of adults were obese. Tests for trend were significant for male and female children and adolescents, indicating an increase in the prevalence of overweight in female children and adolescents from 13.8{\%} in 1999-2000 to 16.0{\%} in 2003-2004 and an increase in the prevalence of overweight in male children and adolescents from 14.0{\%} to 18.2{\%}. Among men, the prevalence of obesity increased significantly between 1999-2000 (27.5{\%}) and 2003-2004 (31.1{\%}). Among women, no significant increase in obesity was observed between 1999-2000 (33.4{\%}) and 2003-2004 (33.2{\%}). The prevalence of extreme obesity (body mass index > or =40) in 2003-2004 was 2.8{\%} in men and 6.9{\%} in women. In 2003-2004, significant differences in obesity prevalence remained by race/ethnicity and by age. Approximately 30{\%} of non-Hispanic white adults were obese as were 45.0{\%} of non-Hispanic black adults and 36.8{\%} of Mexican Americans. Among adults aged 20 to 39 years, 28.5{\%} were obese while 36.8{\%} of adults aged 40 to 59 years and 31.0{\%} of those aged 60 years or older were obese in 2003-2004. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents and obesity among men increased significantly during the 6-year period from 1999 to 2004; among women, no overall increases in the prevalence of obesity were observed. These estimates were based on a 6-year period and suggest that the increases in body weight are continuing in men and in children and adolescents while they may be leveling off in women.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT:  BACKGROUND: The rising prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a major public health problem. There is an urgent need for effective lifestyle interventions to prevent the development of T2DM. Sedentary behaviour (sitting time) has recently been identified as a risk factor for diabetes, often independent of the time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Project STAND (Sedentary Time ANd Diabetes) is a study which aims to reduce sedentary behaviour in younger adults at high risk of T2DM. METHODS: A reduction in sedentary time is targeted using theory driven group structured education. The STAND programme is subject to piloting and process evaluation in line with the MRC framework for complex interventions. Participants are encouraged to self-monitor and self-regulate their behaviour. The intervention is being assessed in a randomised controlled trial with 12 month follow up. Inclusion criteria are a) aged 18-40 years with a BMI in the obese range; b) 18-40 years with a BMI in the overweight range plus an additional risk factor for T2DM. Participants are randomised to the intervention (n=89) or control (n=89) arm. The primary outcome is a reduction in sedentary behaviour at 12 months as measured by an accelerometer (count <100/min). Secondary outcomes include physical activity, sitting/lying time using the ActivPAL posture monitor, fasting and 2h oral glucose tolerance test, lipids, inflammatory biomarkers, body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, illness perceptions, and efficacy beliefs for behaviour change. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first UK trial to address sedentary behaviour change in a population of younger adults at risk of T2DM. The results will provide a platform for the development of a range of future multidisciplinary interventions in this rapidly expanding high-risk population.

abstract = {A growing literature investigates associations between neighborhood social environments and coronary heart disease (CHD). After reviewing the literature, we present a theoretical model of the mechanisms through which geographic life environments may influence CHD, focusing particularly on the social-interactional environment. We suggest that, in addition to the common notions of social cohesion or fragmentation and social disorder, eco-epidemiologists should consider neighborhood identities and stigmatization processes. We posit that neighborhood social interactions affect the wide set of affective, cognitive, and relational experiences individuals have in their neighborhoods, which in turn influence the psycho-cognitive antecedents of behavior and in the end shape health behavior. Finally, we discuss key methodological challenges relevant to the advent of a new generation of neighborhood studies, including the operational definition of neighborhoods, nonresidential environments, ecometric measurement, model specification strategies, mediational models, selection processes and notions of empirical/ structural confounding, and the relevance of observational versus interventional studies.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the years schools have reduced physical education and recess time in favor of more academic instruction. Due to the drastic rise in obesity levels among children, some states have begun to mandate minimum amounts of physical activity (PA) that school children receive, causing schools to find alternative methods for increasing PA levels. Physical Activity Across the Curriculum (PAAC) is a 3-year randomized clinical trial incorporating moderate-intensity PA in elementary schools to reduce childhood obesity. This paper describes the rational, design, and methods of the PAAC intervention study. METHODS: Twenty-two elementary schools were randomized to either a control or intervention condition. In schools randomized to the intervention condition (PAAC), regular classroom teachers were taught how to incorporate PA into standard academic lessons. Teachers were asked to accumulate 90-100 min/week of PAAC each week through out the 3-year study period. Schools randomized to the control group did not alter their teaching methods. Direct observation of PA levels in the classroom was collected weekly. Height and weight was measured twice a year to calculate BMI. RESULTS: Two years of the intervention have been completed and only one school has left the study. The remaining 21 schools are participating in the final intervention year. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the PAAC intervention may provide schools with an alternative method to increase PA levels in children and reduce childhood obesity.},

Two distinct but complementary evaluations of the process, impact, and outcomes of Act 1220 are being conducted: first, surveillance of the weight status of Arkansas children and adolescents, using the statewide data amassed from the required measurements of students' body mass indexes (BMIs); and second, an independent evaluation of the process, impact, and outcomes associated with Act 1220. Various stakeholder groups initially expressed concerns about the Act, specifically concerns related to negative social and emotional consequences for students and an excessive demand on health care. Evaluation data, however, suggest that few adverse effects have occurred either in these areas of concern or in other concerns which have emerged over time. Schools are changing environments and implementing policies and programs to promote healthy behaviors and BMI levels have not increased since the implementation of Act 1220 in 2004. The Arkansas experience to date may serve to inform the efforts of other states to adopt policies to address the epidemic of childhood obesity.},

We perform a content analysis to categorize tracking tools, and to explore user experience (UX) issues related to quantified self technologies. From this analysis, we find various tracking categories, including body state (e.g., physical and physiological), psychological state and traits, activities (e.g., exercise, eating, sleep), social interactions, and environmental and property states. Furthermore, we find the key UX issues associated with quantified self technologies, which include data controllability, data integration, data accuracy, data visualization, input complexity, sharing/privacy, design/aesthetics, and engagement. The UX issues reported in this paper have significant implications for the design of quantified self technologies.},

Nevertheless, the ‘stuff’ that is typically tracked – exercise and diet being the dominant tracking activities – refers to cultural and social practices that, for the individual user, are utterly mundane and reside in an experiential realm of everyday life. Self-tracking has to be understood in relation to behavior that is predominantly about getting things done in ways that are possible, suitable and meaningful for the individual. To account for this, we propose to conceptualize self-tracking as a communicative phenomenon along three dimensions: communication with the system, the self and social networks of peers.

Automated methods to measure travel behaviors will improve research in this area. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning method for transportation mode prediction from global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data. Methods: We collected a dataset of about 150 h of GPS and accelerometer data from two research assistants following a protocol of prescribed trips consisting of five activities: bicycling, riding in a vehicle, walking, sitting, and standing. We extracted 49 features from 1-min windows of this data. We compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms and chose a random forest algorithm to classify the transportation mode. We used a moving average output filter to smooth the output predictions over time. Results: The random forest algorithm achieved 89.8{\%} cross-validated accuracy on this dataset. Adding the moving average filter to smooth output predictions increased the cross-validated accuracy to 91.9{\%}. Conclusion: Machine learning methods are a viable approach for automating measurement of active travel, particularly for measuring travel activities that traditional accelerometer data processing methods misclassify, such as bicycling and vehicle travel.},

abstract = {This paper proposes several Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) indices to measure the agreement among k raters, with each rater having multiple (m) readings from each of the n subjects for continuous and categorical data. In addition, for normal data, this paper also proposes the coverage probability (CP) and total deviation index (TDI). Those indices are used to measure intra, inter and total agreement among all raters. Intra-rater indices are used to measure the agreement among the multiple readings from the same rater. Inter-rater indices are used to measure the agreement among different raters based on the average of multiple readings. Total-rater indices are used to measure the agreement among different raters based on individual readings. In addition to the agreement, the paper also assess intra, inter, and total precision and accuracy. Through a two-way mixed model, all CCC, precision and accuracy, TDI, and CP indices are expressed as functions of variance components, and GEE method is used to obtain the estimates and perform inferences for all the functions of variance components. Each of previous proposed approaches for assessing agreement becomes one of the special case of the proposed approach. For continuous data, when m approaches infinity, the proposed estimates reduce to the agreement indices proposed by Barnhart et al. (2005). When m = 1, the proposed estimate reduces to the ICC proposed by Carrasco and Jover (2003). When m = 1, the proposed estimate also reduces to the OCCC proposed by Lin (1989), King and Chinchilli (2001a) and Barnhart et al. (2002). When m = 1 and k = 2, the proposed estimate reduces to the original CCC proposed by Lin (1989). For categorical data, when k = 2 and m = 1, the proposed estimate and its associated inference reduce to the kappa for binary data and weighted kappa with squared weight for ordinal data.},

@article{Bey2003a,
abstract = {We have examined the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in skeletal muscle during physical inactivity in comparison to low-intensity contractile activity of ambulatory controls. From studies acutely preventing ambulatory activity of one or both the hindlimbs in rats, it was shown that approximately 90-95 {\%} of the heparin-releasable (HR) LPL activity normally present in rat muscle with ambulatory activity is lost, and thus dependent on local contractile activity. Similarly, approximately 95 {\%} of the differences in LPL activity between muscles of different fibre types was dependent on ambulatory activity. The robustness of the finding that physical inactivity significantly decreases muscle LPL activity was evident from confirmatory studies with different models of inactivity, in many rats and mice, both sexes, three muscle types and during both acute and chronic (11 days) treatment. Inactivity caused a local reduction of plasma [3H]triglyceride uptake into muscle and a decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. LPL mRNA was not differentially expressed between ambulatory controls and either the acutely or chronically inactive groups. Instead, the process involved a rapid loss of the HR-LPL protein mass (the portion of LPL largely associated with the vascular endothelium) by an actinomycin D-sensitive signalling mechanism (i.e. transcriptionally dependent process). Significant decreases of intracellular LPL protein content lagged behind the loss of HR-LPL protein. Treadmill walking raised LPL activity approximately 8-fold (P < 0.01) within 4 h after inactivity. The striking sensitivity of muscle LPL to inactivity and low-intensity contractile activity may provide one piece of the puzzle for why inactivity is a risk factor for metabolic diseases and why even non-vigorous activity provides marked protection against disorders involving poor lipid metabolism.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the effect of keeping daily activity records on physical activity levels and self-efficacy for physical activity in adults with type 2 diabetes, and to examine the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention from the perspective of the participants.

METHODS: This intervention study included 58 individuals with type 2 diabetes aged 40 to 65 years. Participants were randomly assigned: individuals in the intervention group kept daily activity records for 6 weeks, mailed to the researcher every 2 weeks. Data collection was completed at the beginning of the study and 6 weeks later, using the habitual physical activity index and the self-efficacy for exercise scale. Participants in the intervention group also completed the perceived feasibility checklist.

RESULTS: The intervention resulted in enhanced self-efficacy. Physical activity improved in both the intervention and control groups. Activity recording was judged to be acceptable and feasible.

CONCLUSIONS: Daily activity recording can be used as part of a program to increase physical activity self-efficacy levels. Focused interactions between health care providers and patients may be enough to motivate people to higher levels of physical activity. The relationship between self-efficacy and behavior is complex and should be the subject of further research.},

abstract = {Advances in mobile computing offer the potential to change when, where, and how health interventions are delivered. Rather than relying on occasional in-clinic interactions, mobile health (mHealth) interventions may overcome constraints due to limited clinician time, poor patient adherence, and inability to provide meaningful interventions at the most appropriate time. Technological capability, however, does not equate with user acceptance and adoption. How then can we ensure that mobile technologies for behavior change meet the needs of their target audience? In this paper, we argue that overcoming acceptance and adoption barriers requires interdisciplinary collaborations, bringing together not only technologists and health researchers but also human-computer interaction (HCI) experts. We discuss the value of human-computer interaction research to the nascent field of mHealth and demonstrate how research from HCI can offer complementary insights on the creation of mobile health interventions. We conclude with a discussion of barriers to interdisciplinary collaborations in mobile health and suggest ways to overcome them.},

abstract = {Lower cost alternatives are needed for the traditional in-person behavioral weight loss programs to overcome challenges of lowering the worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity. Smartphones have become ubiquitous and provide a unique platform to aid in the delivery of a behavioral weight loss program. The technological capabilities of a smartphone may address certain limitations of a traditional weight loss program, while also reducing the cost and burden on participants, interventionists, and health care providers. Awareness of the advantages smartphones offer for weight loss has led to the rapid development and proliferation of weight loss applications (apps). The built-in features and the mechanisms by which they work vary across apps. Although there are an extraordinary number of a weight loss apps available, most lack the same magnitude of evidence-based behavior change strategies typically used in traditional programs. As features develop and new capabilities are identified, we propose a conceptual model as a framework to guide the inclusion of features that can facilitate behavior change and lead to reductions in weight. Whereas the conventional wisdom about behavior change asserts that more is better (with respect to the number of behavior change techniques involved), this model suggests that less may be more because extra techniques may add burden and adversely impact engagement. Current evidence is promising and continues to emerge on the potential of smartphone use within weight loss programs; yet research is unable to keep up with the rapidly improving smartphone technology. Future studies are needed to refine the conceptual model's utility in the use of technology for weight loss, determine the effectiveness of intervention components utilizing smartphone technology, and identify novel and faster ways to evaluate the ever-changing technology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importance of regular physical activity for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is well-established. However, many patients do not meet the recommended daily amount. Accelerometers might provide patients with the information needed to increase physical activity in daily life.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the validity and usability of low-cost Internet-connected accelerometers. Furthermore we explored patients' preferences with regards to the presentation of and feedback on monitored physical activity.

METHODS: To assess concurrent validity we conducted a field validation study with patients who wore two low-cost accelerometers, Fitbit and Physical Activity Monitor (PAM), at the same time along with a sophisticated multisensor accelerometer (SenseWear Armband) for 48 hours. Data on energy expenditure assessed from registrations from the two low-cost accelerometers were compared to the well validated SenseWear Armband which served as a reference criterion. Usability was examined in a cross-over study with patients who, in succession, wore the Fitbit and the PAM for 7 consecutive days and filled out a 16 item questionnaire with regards to the use of the corresponding device

RESULTS: The agreement between energy expenditure (METs) from the SenseWear Armband with METs estimated by the Fitbit and PAM was good (r=.77) and moderate (r=.41), respectively. The regression model that was developed for the Fitbit explained 92{\%} whereas the PAM-model could explain 89{\%} of total variance in METs measured by the SenseWear. With regards to the usability, both the Fitbit and PAM were well rated on all items. There were no significant differences between the two devices.

CONCLUSIONS: The low-cost Fitbit and PAM are valid and usable devices to measure physical activity in patients with COPD. These devices may be useful in long-term interventions aiming at increasing physical activity levels in these patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children over age 2 years spend < or = 2 hours per day with screen media, because excessive viewing has been linked to a plethora of physical, academic, and behavioral problems. The primary goal of this study was to qualitatively explore how a recommendation to limit television viewing might be received and responded to by a diverse sample of parents and their school-age children. METHODS: The study collected background data about media use, gathered a household media inventory, and conducted in-depth individual and small group interviews with 180 parents and children ages 6 to 13 years old. RESULTS: Most of the children reported spending approximately 3 hours per day watching television. The average home in this sample had 4 television sets; nearly two thirds had a television in the child's bedroom, and nearly half had a television set in the kitchen or dining room. Although virtually all of the parents reported having guidelines for children's television viewing, few had rules restricting the time children spend watching television. Data from this exploratory study suggest several potential barriers to implementing a 2-hour limit, including: parents' need to use television as a safe and affordable distraction, parents' own heavy television viewing patterns, the role that television plays in the family's day-to-day routine, and a belief that children should spend their weekend leisure time as they wish. Interviews revealed that for many of these families there is a lack of concern that television viewing is a problem for their child, and there remains confusion about the boundaries of the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics. CONCLUSIONS: Parents in this study expressed interest in taking steps toward reducing children's television time but also uncertainty about how to go about doing so. Results suggest possible strategies to reduce the amount of time children spend in front of the screen.},

abstract = {Background. The study purpose was to establish the number (and type) of days needed to estimate mean pedometer-determined steps/day in a field setting. Methods. Seven days of data were collected from 90 participants (33 males, age = 49.1 ?? 16.2 years, BMI = 27.2 ?? 4.1 kg/m 2; 57 females, age = 44.8 ?? 16.9 years, BMI = 27.0 ?? 5.9 kg/m 2). Mean steps/day were computed for all 7 days (the criterion), each single day, and combinations of days. Analyses included repeated measures ANOVA, intra-class correlations (ICC), and regression. Results. There was a significant difference (P < 0.001) between days. The difference was limited to Sunday and accounted for 5{\%} of the variance. ICC analyses indicated a minimum of 3 days is necessary to achieve a reliability of 0.80. The adjusted R 2 was 0.79 for a single day (specifically Wednesday), 0.89 for 2 days (Wednesday, Thursday), and 0.94 for 3 days (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday). Sunday was the last day to enter the model. Conclusions. Although there is a statistical difference between days, there is little practical difference, and the primary distinction appears limited to Sunday. Although a single day of collection is not acceptable, any 3 days can provide a sufficient estimate. ?? 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity is one of the most important public health issues in the U.S. and internationally. Increasingly, links are being identified between various elements of the physical-or built-environment and physical activity. To understand the impact of the built environment on physical activity, the development of high-quality measures is essential. Three categories of built environment data are being used: (1) perceived measures obtained by telephone interview or self-administered questionnaires; (2) observational measures obtained using systematic observational methods (audits); and (3) archival data sets that are often layered and analyzed with GIS. This review provides a critical assessment of these three types of built-environment measures relevant to the study of physical activity. Among perceived measures, 19 questionnaires were reviewed, ranging in length from 7 to 68 questions. Twenty audit tools were reviewed that cover community environments (i.e., neighborhoods, cities), parks, and trails. For GIS-derived measures, more than 50 studies were reviewed. A large degree of variability was found in the operationalization of common GIS measures, which include population density, land-use mix, access to recreational facilities, and street pattern. This first comprehensive examination of built-environment measures demonstrates considerable progress over the past decade, showing diverse environmental variables available that use multiple modes of assessment. Most can be considered first-generation measures, so further development is needed. In particular, further research is needed to improve the technical quality of measures, understand the relevance to various population groups, and understand the utility of measures for science and public health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) ambulatory disease management programs appear to offer the greatest benefit to HF patients at highest risk, defined as having New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class III or IV symptoms. The Latitude Patient Management System is the first HF management tool to use wireless telemetry present in a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device that is linked to remotely collect blood pressure and weight measures, permitting a single transmission reporting device data. Potential advantages of this system include ease of data transmissions, correlation among measures of HF status, arrhythmic events, and device performance. However, the use and ultimate utility of these combined features for patient management are untested.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Remote Active Monitoring in Patients with Heart Failure (RAPID-RF) study is a multicenter registry that will enroll up to 1000 patients on the Latitude Patient Management System from approximately 100 centers. The primary objective is to examine physician responses to Latitude Active Monitoring data alerts by assessing alert-related medical interventions. Minimum follow-up will be 3 months after implant with a maximum follow-up time of 24 months after implant.

CONCLUSIONS: The RAPID-RF study will provide important preliminary data on how remotely collected HF and arrhythmic surveillance data alter the management of HF patients with CRT-D devices.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systematic study of human behavior in public parks and specific activity settings can inform policy to promote physical activity in diverse communities. METHODS: Direct observation was used to assess physical activity in public parks in Tampa FL (n=10) and Chicago IL (n=18). Parks were selected from census tracts with high concentrations of white, African-American, and Hispanic populations. Representation from low- and high-income census tracts was also achieved. Physical activity was measured by a modified version of the System for Observing Play and Leisure Activity in Youth (SOPLAY). Activity codes from SOPLAY were transformed to energy expenditure per person (kcal/kg/min). RESULTS: Seventy percent of Tampa and 51{\%} of Chicago park users were observed engaged in sedentary behavior. In both cities, children were more likely than adults to be observed in walking or vigorous activity. In Tampa, parks located in neighborhoods with the highest concentration of Hispanic residents were associated with greatest levels of energy expenditure. In Chicago, parks in neighborhoods with the highest concentration of African Americans showed the highest energy expenditure per person. Gender was associated with physical activity only in Tampa parks. Energy expenditure also varied by activity areas. CONCLUSIONS: More than one half of park users in both cities engaged in sedentary behavior. While differences in park-based physical activity by neighborhood income and racial/ethnic composition were observed, these differences can more likely be attributed to the types of designated activity areas that support physical activity. The study findings suggest that specific configurations of park environments can enhance physical activity in parks.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether neighbourhood characteristics are related to dietary patterns independently of individual level variables. DESIGN: A cross sectional analysis of the relation between neighbourhood median household income and food and nutrient intakes, before and after adjustment for individual level variables. SETTING: Four United States communities (Washington Co, MD; Suburban Minneapolis, MN; Forsyth Co, NC, and Jackson, MS). PARTICIPANTS: 13,095 adults aged 45 to 64 years participating in the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, a prospective study of atherosclerosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Information on diet and individual level income was obtained from the baseline examination of the ARIC Study. Diet was assessed using a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Information on neighbourhood (census defined block groups) median household income was obtained from the 1990 US Census. Multilevel models were used to account for the multilevel structure of the data. Living in lower income neighbourhoods was generally associated with decreased energy adjusted intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, and increased intake of meat. Patterns generally persisted after adjustment for individual level income, but were often not statistically significant. Inconsistent associations were recorded for the intake of saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and cholesterol. Overall, individual level income was a more consistent predictor of diet than neighbourhood income. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations in the definition and characterisation of neighbourhoods, this study found consistent (albeit small) differences across neighbourhoods in food intake, suggesting that more in depth research into potential neighbourhood level determinants of diet is warranted.},

abstract = {In prior research, neighborhood effects have often been weak or inconsistent in predicting specific causes of mortality and morbidity. To determine whether residential neighborhood effects are suppressed by exposure to other environments, we examined the effect on adult self-rated health of non-residential environments that figure in individuals' daily routines. We linked the 2000 US Census data with the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study (L.A.FANS) database, which consists of 3323 adults sampled from neighborhoods in LA County. Characteristics of census tracts where respondents lived, worked, shopped, sought medical care, worshipped and spent "other" time were obtained from the 2000 US Census. Weighted multilevel linear and clustered generalized ordered logistic regressions were used to estimate associations between self-rated health and non-residential neighborhood exposures after adjustment for individual-level factors and exposure to residential neighborhoods. We found that residence in disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with worse self-rated health. In a dose-response fashion, the greater the exposure to less disadvantaged non-residential neighborhoods in the course of routine activities, the greater the magnitude in improved self-rated health. Models including non-residential neighborhood exposure increase the magnitude and significance of the association between residential neighborhoods and health. In conclusion, individuals' exposure to non-residential neighborhoods confounds and suppresses the association of residential neighborhoods with health and could explain why previous studies may not have found robust associations between residential neighborhood predictors and health.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Community parks provide places for people to be physically active. Our objective was to determine how access to, barriers to use of, and use of community parks differ by race/ethnicity. METHODS: Analyses are based on a cross-sectional national sample of adults (N = 5,157) participating in the 2006 HealthStyles mail survey. Community parks were defined as outdoor public areas within 10 miles or a 20-minute drive from where a person lives that include walking/bike paths, nature preserves, playgrounds, beaches, lakes, rivers, or similar places. RESULTS: Overall, 12{\%} of respondents reported not having a community park. Among those with a community park, 14{\%} reported personal safety concerns and 14{\%} reported inadequate or poorly maintained facilities as barriers to park use. Race/ethnicity was not associated with park access; however, Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to report barriers. Among those with access to a community park, 83{\%} reported any park use in the previous year and, of these, 67{\%} reported an active visit. Odds of any park use did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity. Odds of an active visit were significantly lower in non-Hispanic blacks than whites (odds ratio, 0.67) but did not significantly differ between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. CONCLUSION: Parks are valuable community resources to all racial/ethnic groups. To promote and increase community park use, it is important to be aware that parks are used differently by different racial/ethnic groups and that barriers may differentially influence park use.},

We examined the cross-sectional association between psychological distress, television and screen entertainment time, and physical activity levels among a representative sample of children aged 4 to 12 years from the 2003 Scottish Health Survey. METHODS: Participants were 1486 boys and girls (mean age: 8.5 +/- 2.3 years). Parents answered on behalf of children who were required to be present. The parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and information on television and screen entertainment time, physical activity, and dietary intake of their children. RESULTS: An abnormally high Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total difficulties score (20-40) was found in 4.2{\%} of the sample. Approximately 25{\%} of the children were exposed to television and screen entertainment at least 3 hours/day. In general linear models, television and screen entertainment time per week and physical activity levels were independently associated with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total difficulties score after adjustment for age, gender, area deprivation level, single-parent status, medical conditions, and various dietary intake indicators. There was also an additive interaction effect showing that the combination of high television and screen entertainment time and low physical activity was associated with the highest Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire score. Higher television and screen entertainment exposure (>2.7 hours/day) alone resulted in a 24{\%} increase in the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire score in comparison with lower television and screen entertainment exposure (<1.6 hours/day), although when combined with low physical activity this resulted in a 46{\%} increase. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of television and screen entertainment time and low physical activity levels interact to increase psychological distress in young children.},

Cross-sectional, stratified, random sample from secondary schools in 15 regions within the United Kingdom. The data are from a larger study of adolescent lifestyles (Project STIL). Participants. A total of 561 boys with a mean age of 14.6 years (range 12.7-16.7 years). The majority were white-European (86.5{\%}). Main results. Television viewing occupied the most leisure time on both weekdays (131 minutes) and weekend (202.5 minutes) days. On weekdays the five most time consuming sedentary activities (television viewing, homework, motorised travel, playing computer/video games and shopping/hanging out) occupied on average 272.2 minutes. On weekend days, the five most time consuming sedentary activities (television viewing, shopping/hanging out, motorised travel, sitting and talking and playing computer/video games) occupied 405.5 minutes. In total, 54 minutes were occupied by active transport or sports and exercise per weekday and 81 minutes per weekend day. Only a minority watched more than 4 hours of TV per day (8.9{\%} on weekdays and 33.8{\%} on weekend days). Differences were noted in the means and prevalence between weekend and weekdays, reflecting the greater discretionary time available at the weekend. Conclusions. Adolescent boys engage in a variety of sedentary and active free time behaviours. It appears prudent to encourage adolescents to adopt overall healthy lifestyles by considering the combination of both active and sedentary pursuits an individual engages in and by moving beyond a focus on any one single behaviour.},

Future obesity-related health-care costs for adults were estimated using projected prevalence, Census population projections, and published national estimates of per capita excess health-care costs of obesity/overweight. The objective was to illustrate potential burden of obesity prevalence and health-care costs of obesity and overweight in the United States that would occur if current trends continue. Overweight and obesity prevalence have increased steadily among all US population groups, but with notable differences between groups in annual increase rates. The increase (percentage points) in obesity and overweight in adults was faster than in children (0.77 vs. 0.46-0.49), and in women than in men (0.91 vs. 0.65). If these trends continue, by 2030, 86.3{\%} adults will be overweight or obese; and 51.1{\%}, obese. Black women (96.9{\%}) and Mexican-American men (91.1{\%}) would be the most affected. By 2048, all American adults would become overweight or obese, while black women will reach that state by 2034. In children, the prevalence of overweight (BMI >/= 95th percentile, 30{\%}) will nearly double by 2030. Total health-care costs attributable to obesity/overweight would double every decade to 860.7-956.9 billion US dollars by 2030, accounting for 16-18{\%} of total US health-care costs. We continue to move away from the Healthy People 2010 objectives. Timely, dramatic, and effective development and implementation of corrective programs/policies are needed to avoid the otherwise inevitable health and societal consequences implied by our projections .},

Schools were matched on school size and type of food service and randomly assigned to intervention or control. Students were assessed at baseline and again after 2 years. The School Nutrition Policy Initiative included the following components: school self-assessment, nutrition education, nutrition policy, social marketing, and parent outreach. RESULTS: The incidences of overweight and obesity after 2 years were primary outcomes. The prevalence and remission of overweight and obesity, BMI z score, total energy and fat intake, fruit and vegetable consumption, body dissatisfaction, and hours of activity and inactivity were secondary outcomes. The intervention resulted in a 50{\%} reduction in the incidence of overweight. Significantly fewer children in the intervention schools (7.5{\%}) than in the control schools (14.9{\%}) became overweight after 2 years. The prevalence of overweight was lower in the intervention schools. No differences were observed in the incidence or prevalence of obesity or in the remission of overweight or obesity at 2 years. CONCLUSION: A multicomponent school-based intervention can be effective in preventing the development of overweight among children in grades 4 through 6 in urban public schools with a high proportion of children eligible for free and reduced-priced school meals.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Rates of obesity and other childhood chronic conditions have increased over recent decades. Patterns of how conditions change over time have not been widely examined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate change in prevalence of obesity and other chronic conditions in US children, including incidence, remission, and prevalence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Cohort (1988-2006) of 3 nationally representative cohorts of children. Children were aged 2 through 8 years at the beginning of each study period, and cohorts were followed up for 6 years, from 1988 to 1994 (cohort 1, n = 2337), 1994 to 2000 (cohort 2, n = 1759), and 2000 to 2006 (n = 905). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parent report of a child having a health condition that limited activities or schooling or required medicine, special equipment, or specialized health services and that lasted at least 12 months. Obesity was defined as a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for age. Chronic conditions were grouped into 4 categories: obesity, asthma, other physical conditions, and behavior/learning problems. RESULTS: The end-study prevalence of any chronic health condition was 12.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 11.2{\%}-14.5{\%}) for cohort 1 in 1994, 25.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 22.7{\%}-27.6{\%}) for cohort 2 in 2000, and 26.6{\%} (95{\%} CI, 23.5{\%}-29.9{\%}) for cohort 3 in 2006. There was substantial turnover in chronic conditions: 7.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 6.5{\%}-8.3{\%}) of participants in all cohorts had a chronic condition at the beginning of the study that persisted to the end, 9.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 8.3{\%}-10.3{\%}) reported conditions at the beginning that resolved within 6 years, and 13.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 12.3{\%}-14.6{\%}) had new conditions that arose during the 6-year study period. The prevalence of having a chronic condition during any part of the 6-year study period was highest for cohort 3 (51.5{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 47.3{\%}-55.0{\%}), and there were higher rates among male (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.42), Hispanic (AOR, 1.36; 95{\%} CI, 1.11-1.67), and black (AOR, 1.60; 95{\%} CI, 1.35-1.90) youth. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of chronic conditions among children and youth increased from 1988 to 2006. However, presence of these conditions was dynamic over each 6-year cohort.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the validity of the total energy expenditure (TEE) estimated using uniaxial (ACCuni) and triaxial (ACCtri) accelerometers in the elderly. Thirty-two healthy elderly (64-87 years) participated in this study. TEE was measured using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method (TEE(DLW)). TEE(ACCuni) (6.79 +/- 1.08 MJ day(-1)) was significantly lower than TEE(DLW) (7.85 +/- 1.54 MJ day(-1)) and showed wider limits of agreement (-3.15 to 1.12 MJ day(-1)) with a smaller correlation coefficient (r = 0.703). TEE(ACCtri) (7.88 +/- 1.27 MJ day(-1)) did not differ from TEE(DLW) and showed narrower limits of agreement (-1.64 to 1.72 MJ day(-1)) with a larger correlation coefficient (r = 0.835, P < 0.001). The estimated intensities of light activities were significantly lower with ACCuni. Greater mediolateral acceleration was observed during 6-min walk tests. The results suggest that ACCtri is a better choice than ACCuni for assessing TEE in the elderly.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study explored young adults' experiences of using e-health internet-based computer or mobile phone applications (apps) and what they valued about those apps.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a community sample of 19 young adults who had used a publicly available phone or internet-based application. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.

RESULTS: Participants valued an attractive user interface. Structure, ease of use, personalised features and accessibility (including dual phone-computer access) were all important to participants and users indicated that continued use depended on these design features. Many believed that a focus on calorie counting was too limiting. Some users mentioned behaviour change strategies and known behaviour change techniques utilised by apps including; self-monitoring, goal setting and behavioural feedback. Only a few users reported positive changes in physical activity levels.

CONCLUSIONS: Use of particular design features and application of evidence-based behaviour change techniques could optimise continued use and the effectiveness of internet/smart phone interventions. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? E-health is increasingly used to deliver weight loss/control programs. Most e-health programs have not been founded on evidence-based designs and it is unclear what features and functions users find useful or not so useful. What does this study add? Weight loss app users valued structure, ease of use, personalised features and accessibility. Goal setting and feedback on calorie intake/energy balance were the most widely used behaviour change techniques. Designers should consider an extensive food database, a food scanner, and provision of diaries.},

@article{Story2009,
abstract = {CONTEXT: Research consistently shows that the majority of American children do not consume diets that meet the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, nor do they achieve adequate levels of daily physical activity. As a result, more children are overweight today than at any other time in U.S. history. Schools offer many opportunities to develop strategies to prevent obesity by creating environments in which children eat healthfully and engage regularly in physical activity. METHODS: This article discusses the role of schools in obesity prevention efforts. Current issues in schools' food and physical activity environments are examined, as well as federal, state, and local policies related to food and physical activity standards in schools. The article is organized around four key areas: (1) school food environments and policies, (2) school physical activity environments and policies, (3) school body mass index measurements, and (4) school wellness policies. Recommendations for accelerating change also are addressed. FINDINGS: The article found that (1) competitive foods (foods sold outside of federally reimbursed school meals) are widely available in schools, especially secondary schools. Studies have related the availability of snacks and drinks sold in schools to students' high intake of total calories, soft drinks, total fat and saturated fat, and lower intake of fruits and vegetables; (2) physical activity can be added to the school curriculum without academic consequences and also can offer physical, emotional, and social benefits. Policy leadership has come predominantly from the districts, then the states, and, to a much lesser extent, the federal government; (3) few studies have examined the effectiveness or impact of school-based BMI measurement programs; and (4) early comparative analyses of local school wellness policies suggest that the strongest policies are found in larger school districts and districts with a greater number of students eligible for a free or reduced-price lunch. CONCLUSIONS: Studies show that schools have been making some progress in improving the school food and physical activity environments but that much more work is needed. Stronger policies are needed to provide healthier meals to students at schools; limit their access to low-nutrient, energy-dense foods during the school day; and increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of physical activity at school.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study explored the influence of modernity on the physical activity behaviors (e.g., intensity and timing) of children. METHODS: Children aged 8-13 yr living a traditional lifestyle (Old Order Amish [OOA], n = 68; Old Order Mennonite [OOM], n = 120) were compared with children living a contemporary lifestyle (rural Saskatchewan [RSK], n = 132; urban Saskatchewan [USK], n = 93). Physical activity was objectively assessed for seven consecutive days using Actigraph 7164 accelerometers. Custom software was used to reduce the raw accelerometer data into standardized outcome variables. RESULTS: On weekdays, there were group differences in moderate physical activity between all lifestyle groups (OOA > OOM > USK > RSK). On the weekend, the group differences in moderate physical activity persisted between, but not within, lifestyle groups (OOA = OOM > USK = RSK). During school hours, all groups had similar activity and inactivity periods; however, they differed in magnitude, with the OOA and OOM being both more sedentary and more active. In comparison with the children in school, the OOA and the OOM children had 44{\%} lower sedentary time out of school compared with only 15{\%} lower for RSK and USK children. CONCLUSIONS: Although cross sectional, these data suggest that contemporary/modern living is associated with lower levels of moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity compared with lifestyles representative of earlier generations. Analyzing the physical activity and inactivity patterns of traditional lifestyle groups such as the OOA and the OOM can provide valuable insight into the quantity and quality of physical activity necessary to promote health.},

Quantified self involves ordinary people recording and analyzing numerous aspects of their lives to understand and improve themselves. This is now a mainstream phenomenon, attracting a great deal of attention, participation, and funding. As more people are attracted to the movement, companies are offering various new platforms (hardware and software) that allow ever more aspects of daily life to be tracked. Nearly every aspect of the QS ecosystem is advancing rapidly, except for analytic capabilities, which remain surprisingly primitive.

The effect of reducing television watching and other sedentary behaviors as a component of a comprehensive obesity treatment program has not been thoroughly tested. OBJECTIVE: To compare the influence of targeting decreases in sedentary behavior vs. increases in physical activity in the comprehensive treatment of obesity in 8- to 12-year-old children. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled outcome study. SETTING: Childhood obesity research clinic. DESIGN: Ninety families with obese 8- to 12-year-old children were randomly assigned to groups that were provided a comprehensive family-based behavioral weight control program that included dietary, and behavior change information but differed in whether sedentary or physically active behaviors were targeted and the degree of behavior change required. RESULTS: Results during 2 years showed that targeting either decreased sedentary behaviors or increased physical activity was associated with significant decreases in percent overweight and body fat and improved aerobic fitness. Self-reported activity minutes increased and targeted sedentary time decreased during treatment. Children substituted nontargeted sedentary behaviors for some of their targeted sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSION: These results support reducing sedentary behaviors as an adjunct in the treatment of pediatric obesity.},

abstract = {Dietary intervention trials aim to change dietary patterns of individuals. Participating in such trials could impact dietary self-report in divergent ways: Dietary counseling and training on portion-size estimation could improve self-report accuracy; participant burden could increase systematic error. Such intervention-associated biases could complicate interpretation of trial results. The authors investigated intervention-associated biases in reported total carotenoid intake using data on 3,088 breast cancer survivors recruited between 1995 and 2000 and followed through 2006 in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study, a randomized intervention trial. Longitudinal data from 2 self-report methods (24-hour recalls and food frequency questionnaires) and a plasma carotenoid biomarker were collected. A flexible measurement error model was postulated. Parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework by using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Results indicated that the validity (i.e., correlation with "true" intake) of both self-report methods was significantly higher during follow-up for intervention versus nonintervention participants (4-year validity estimates: intervention = 0.57 for food frequency questionnaires and 0.58 for 24-hour recalls; nonintervention = 0.42 for food frequency questionnaires and 0.48 for 24-hour recalls). However, within- and between-instrument error correlations during follow-up were higher among intervention participants, indicating an increase in systematic error. Diet interventions can impact measurement errors of dietary self-report. Appropriate statistical methods should be applied to examine intervention-associated biases when interpreting results of diet trials.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine relationships between physical fitness and academic achievement in diverse, urban public school children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used public school data from 2004 to 2005. Academic achievement was assessed as a passing score on Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) achievement tests in Mathematics (fourth, sixth, and eighth grade, n = 1103) and in English (fourth and seventh grade, n = 744). Fitness achievement was assessed as the number of physical fitness tests passed during physical education (PE). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the probability of passing the MCAS tests, controlling for students' weight status (BMI z score), ethnicity, gender, grade, and socioeconomic status (school lunch enrollment). RESULTS: The odds of passing both the MCAS Mathematics test and the MCAS English test increased as the number of fitness tests passed increased (p < .0001 and p < .05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Results show statistically significant relationships between fitness and academic achievement, though the direction of causation is not known. While more research is required, promoting fitness by increasing opportunities for physical activity during PE, recess, and out of school time may support academic achievement.},

abstract = {Research is now required on factors influencing adults' sedentary behaviors, and effective approaches to behavioral-change intervention must be identified. The strategies for influencing sedentary behavior will need to be informed by evidence on the most important modifiable behavioral determinants. However, much of the available evidence relevant to understanding the determinants of sedentary behaviors is from cross-sectional studies, which are limited in that they identify only behavioral "correlates." As is the case for physical activity, a behavior- and context-specific approach is needed to understand the multiple determinants operating in the different settings within which these behaviors are most prevalent. To this end, an ecologic model of sedentary behaviors is described, highlighting the behavior settings construct. The behaviors and contexts of primary concern are TV viewing and other screen-focused behaviors in domestic environments, prolonged sitting in the workplace, and time spent sitting in automobiles. Research is needed to clarify the multiple levels of determinants of prolonged sitting time, which are likely to operate in distinct ways in these different contexts. Controlled trials on the feasibility and efficacy of interventions to reduce and break up sedentary behaviors among adults in domestic, workplace, and transportation environments are particularly required. It would be informative for the field to have evidence on the outcomes of "natural experiments," such as the introduction of nonseated working options in occupational environments or new transportation infrastructure in communities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have shown self-monitoring can modify health behaviors, including physical activity (PA). This study tested the utility of a wearable sensor/device (Fitbit(®) One™; Fitbit Inc., San Francisco, CA) and short message service (SMS) text-messaging prompts to increase PA in overweight and obese adults.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven adults wore a Fitbit One tracker for 6 weeks; half were randomized to also receive three daily SMS-based PA prompts. The Fitbit One consisted of a wearable tracker for instant feedback on performance and a Web site/mobile application (app) for detailed summaries. Outcome measures were objectively measured steps and minutes of PA by intensity using two accelerometers: Actigraph™ (Pensacola, FL) GT3X+ (primary measure) at baseline and Week 6 and Fitbit One (secondary measure) at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

RESULTS: Mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of primary measures indicated a significant within-group increase of +4.3 (standard error [SE]=2.0) min/week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) at 6-week follow-up (p=0.04) in the comparison group (Fitbit only), but no study group differences across PA levels. Secondary measures indicated the SMS text-messaging effect lasted for only 1 week: the intervention group increased by +1,266 steps (SE=491; p=0.01), +17.8 min/week MVPA (SE=8.5; p=0.04), and +38.3 min/week total PA (SE=15.9; p=0.02) compared with no changes in the comparison group, and these between-group differences were significant for steps (p=0.01), fairly/very active minutes (p<0.01), and total active minutes (p=0.02).

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the Fitbit One achieved a small increase in MVPA at follow-up and that the SMS-based PA prompts were insufficient in increasing PA beyond 1 week. Future studies can test this intervention in those requiring less help and/or test strategies to increase participants' engagement levels.},

abstract = {Rapid technological advances in devices used for data collection have led to the emergence of a new class of longitudinal data: intensive longitudinal data (ILD). Behavioral scientific studies now frequently utilize handheld computers, beepers, web interfaces, and other technological tools for collecting many more data points over time than previously possible. Other protocols, such as those used in fMRI and monitoring of public safety, also produce ILD, hence the statistical models in this volume are applicable to a range of data. The volume features state-of-the-art statistical modeling strategies developed by leading statisticians and methodologists working on ILD in conjunction with behavioral scientists. Chapters present applications from across the behavioral and health sciences, including coverage of substantive topics such as stress, smoking cessation, alcohol use, traffic patterns, educational performance and intimacy. Models for Intensive Longitudinal Data (MILD) is designed for those who want to learn about advanced statistical models for intensive longitudinal data and for those with an interest in selecting and applying a given model. The chapters highlight issues of general concern in modeling these kinds of data, such as a focus on regulatory systems, issues of curve registration, variable frequency and spacing of measurements, complex multivariate patterns of change, and multiple independent series. The extraordinary breadth of coverage makes this an indispensable reference for principal investigators designing new studies that will introduce ILD, applied statisticians working on related models, and methodologists, graduate students, and applied analysts working in a range of fields.

METHODS: Participants (N = 289, 44.6{\%} male, mean age = 35.93) from 3 countries completed self-administered long- and short-IPAQ sitting items. Participants wore accelerometers; were classified as inactive (no leisure-time activity), insufficiently active, or meeting recommendations; and were classified into tertiles of sitting behavior. RESULTS: Reliability of sitting time was acceptable for men and women. Correlations between total sitting and accelerometer counts/min <100 were significant for both long (r = .33) and short (r = .34) forms. There was no agreement between tertiles of sitting and the inactivity category (kappa = .02, P = .68). CONCLUSION: Sedentary behavior should be explicitly measured in population surveillance and research instead of being defined by lack of physical activity.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare in-school and out-of-school physical activity within a representative sample. Socio-demographic, physical activity, and anthropometric data were collected from a random sample of children (250 boys, 253 girls) aged 3-16 years attending nine primary and two secondary schools. Actigraph GT1M accelerometers, worn for seven days, were used to estimate physical activity levels for in-school (typically 09.00-15.00 h), out-of-school (weekday), and weekend periods. Physical activity as accelerometer counts per minute were lower in school versus out of school overall (in school: 437.2 +/- 172.9; out of school: 575.5 +/- 202.8; P < 0.001), especially in secondary school pupils (secondary: 321.6 +/- 127.5; primary: 579.2 +/- 216.3; P < 0.001). Minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity accumulated in school accounted for 29.4 +/- 9.8{\%} of total weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity overall but varied by sector (preschool: 37.4 +/- 6.2{\%}; primary: 33.6 +/- 8.1{\%}; secondary: 23.0 +/- 9.3{\%}; F = 114.3, P < 0.001). Approximately half of the children with the lowest in-school activity compensated out of school during the week (47.4{\%}) and about one-third at the weekend (30.0{\%}). Overall, physical activity during the school day appears to be lower than that out of school, especially in secondary school children, who accumulate a lower proportion of their total weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at school than younger children. As low in-school activity was compensated for beyond the school setting by less than half of children, promoting physical activity within the school day is important, especially in secondary schools.},

First, lifetime physical inactivity confers no apparent effects on a given set of physiological functions. Second, lifetime physical inactivity accelerates secondary aging (e.g., speeding the reduction in bone mineral density, maximal oxygen consumption, and skeletal muscle strength and power), but does not alter the primary aging of these systems. Third, a lifetime of physical activity to the age of {\~{}}60-70 years old totally prevents decrements in some age-associated risk factors for major chronic diseases, such as endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance. The present review provides ample and compelling evidence that physical inactivity has a large impact in shortening average life expectancy. In summary, physical inactivity plays a major role in the secondary aging of many essential physiological functions, and this aging can be prevented through a lifetime of physical activity.},

Also commonly know as "feasibility" or "vanguard" studies, they are designed to assess the safety of treatment or interventions; to assess recruitment potential; to assess the feasibility of international collaboration or coordination for multicentre trials; to increase clinical experience with the study medication or intervention for the phase III trials. They are the best way to assess feasibility of a large, expensive full-scale study, and in fact are an almost essential pre-requisite. Conducting a pilot prior to the main study can enhance the likelihood of success of the main study and potentially help to avoid doomed main studies.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth shows promise for supporting patients in managing their long-term health conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it is currently unclear how patients, and particularly older people, may benefit from these technological interventions.

AIM: To explore patients' expectations and experiences of using a mobile telehealth-based (mHealth) application and to determine how such a system may impact on their perceived wellbeing and ability to manage their COPD.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Embedded qualitative study using interviews with patients with COPD from various community NHS services: respiratory community nursing service, general practice, and pulmonary rehabilitation.

METHOD: An embedded qualitative study was conducted to which patients were recruited using purposive sampling to achieve maximum variation. Interviews were carried out prior to receiving the mHealth system and again after a 6-month period. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach.

RESULTS: The sample comprised 19 patients (aged 50-85 years) with varied levels of computer skills. Patients identified no difficulties in using the mHealth application. The main themes encapsulating patients' experience of using the mHealth application related to an increased awareness of the variability of their symptoms (onset of exacerbation and recovery time) and reassurance through monitoring (continuity of care).

CONCLUSION: Patients were able to use the mHealth application, interpret clinical data, and use these within their self-management approach regardless of previous knowledge. Telehealth interventions can complement current clinical care pathways to support self-management behaviour.},

abstract = {Introduction: Despite the known advantages of objective physical activity monitors (e.g., accelerometers), these devices have high rates of non-wear, which leads to missing data. Objective activity monitors are also unable to capture valuable contextual information about behavior. Adolescents recruited into physical activity surveillance and intervention studies will increasingly have smartphones, which are miniature computers with built-in motion sensors. Methods: This paper describes the design and development of a smartphone application (“app”) called Mobile Teen that combines objective and self-report assessment strategies through (1) sensor-informed context-sensitive ecological momentary assessment (CS-EMA) and (2) sensor-assisted end-of-day recall.Results: The Mobile Teen app uses the mobile phone’s built-in motion sensor to automatically detect likely bouts of phone non-wear, sedentary behavior, and physical activity. The app then uses transitions between these inferred states to trigger CS-EMA self-report surveys measuring the type, purpose, and context of activity in real time. The end of the day recall component of the Mobile Teen app allows users to interactively review and label their own physical activity data each evening using visual cues from automatically-detected major activity transitions from the phone’s built-in motions sensors. Major activity transitions are identified by the app, which cues the user to label that “chunk,” or period, of time using activity categories.Conclusions: Sensor-driven CS-EMA and end-of-day recall smartphone apps can be used to augment physical activity data collected by objective activity monitors, filling in gaps during non-wear bouts and providing additional real-time data on environmental, social, and emotional correlates of behavior. Smartphone apps such as these have potential for affordable deployment in large scale epidemiological and intervention studies.},

PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a theory-based physical activity (PA) intervention delivered to postnatal women primarily via mobile telephone short message service (SMS). METHODS: Eighty-eight women were randomized to the intervention (n = 45) or minimal contact control (n = 43) condition. The 12-week intervention consisted of a face-to-face PA goal-setting consultation, a goal-setting magnet, three to five personally tailored SMS/week and a nominated support person who received two SMS per week. SMS content targeted constructs of social cognitive theory. Frequency (days/week) and duration (min/week) of PA participation and walking for exercise were assessed via self-report at baseline, 6 and 13 weeks. RESULTS: Intervention participants increased PA frequency by 1.82 days/week (SE +/- 0.18) by 13 weeks (F ((2,85)) = 4.46, p = 0.038) and walking for exercise frequency by 1.08 days/week (SE +/- 0.24) by 13 weeks (F ((2,85)) = 5.38, p = 0.02). Positive trends were observed for duration (min/week) of PA and walking for exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention exposure resulted in increased frequency of PA and walking for exercise in postnatal women.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare a technology-based system, an in-person behavioral weight loss intervention, and a combination of both over a 6-month period in overweight adults. Fifty-one subjects (age: 44.2 ± 8.7 years, BMI: 33.7 ± 3.6 kg/m(2)) participated in a 6-month behavioral weight loss program and were randomized to one of three groups: standard behavioral weight loss (SBWL), SBWL plus technology-based system (SBWL+TECH), or technology-based system only (TECH). All groups reduced caloric intake and progressively increased moderate intensity physical activity. SBWL and SBWL+TECH attended weekly meetings. SBWL+TECH also received a TECH that included an energy monitoring armband and website to monitor energy intake and expenditure. TECH used the technology system and received monthly telephone calls. Body weight and physical activity were assessed at 0 and 6 months. Retention at 6 months was significantly different (P = 0.005) between groups (SBWL: 53{\%}, SBWL+TECH: 100{\%}, and TECH: 77{\%}). Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis revealed significant weight losses at 6 months in SBWL+TECH (-8.8 ± 5.0 kg, -8.7 ± 4.7{\%}), SBWL (-3.7 ± 5.7 kg, -4.1 ± 6.3{\%}), and TECH (-5.8 ± 6.6 kg, -6.3 ± 7.1{\%}) (P < 0.001). Self-report physical activity increased significantly in SBWL (473.9 ± 800.7 kcal/week), SBWL+TECH (713.9 ± 1,278.8 kcal/week), and TECH (1,066.2 ± 1,371 kcal/week) (P < 0.001), with no differences between groups (P = 0.25). The TECH used in conjunction with monthly telephone calls, produced similar, if not greater weight losses and changes in physical activity than the standard in-person behavioral program at 6 months. The use of this technology may provide an effective short-term clinical alternative to standard in-person behavioral weight loss interventions, with the longer term effects warranting investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure (BP) has been reported in young people and seems to be associated with body mass index (BMI) and reduced physical activity (PA). AIM: This study sought to analyse the association of BP with BMI, PA intensity patterns and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in youth. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out including 66 boys (13.91+/-1.76) and 97 girls (14.02+/-1.71). Anthropometric characteristics, CRF and BP were assessed during school time and accelerometers were utilized to determine intensity of PA. RESULTS: The linear regression model, adjusted for age, sex and height, showed that higher values of BMI were associated (p<or=0.05) with higher values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) (1.39; 95{\%} CI: 0.56; 2.23) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (1.52; 95{\%} CI: 0.68; 2.37). Additionally, SBP, but not DBP, was inversely associated (p<or=0.05) with moderate PA (-0.25; 95{\%} CI: -0.47; -0.02) and positively correlated with sedentary activities (0.04; 95{\%} CI: 0.00; 0.08). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that BMI and time spent in sedentary activities were inversely associated with SBP. However, time spent in moderate PA was positively associated with SBP. BMI was the single predictor of DBP.},

abstract = {We re-examine the pace of rising obesity among Hispanic immigrants and the effects associated with longer duration in the US, or what is referred to as unhealthy assimilation, the convergence of immigrant health to a less healthy native-born standard. Consistent with previous research, we find that across all race-ethnic groups, immigrants tend to be less obese than native-born persons. Second, obesity is clearly on the rise, with obesity rates increasing for both immigrant and native-born populations between 1995 and 2005. However, our findings are that immigrant obesity rises more slowly than for native-born Hispanics in the same age cohort. The significance is that immigrants do not converge to obesity prevalence of the native-born as commonly assumed and, in fact, the differential is wider in 2005 than it was in 1995. The analysis, which is based on the National Health Interview Survey tracks the obesity rates of different cohort populations observed in repeated cross-sections (1995 and 2005), as both immigrants and the native-born grow older and additionally, as immigrants reside in the U.S. longer. More specifically, for immigrants, our study distinguishes the effects of length of U.S. residence (observed at a single point in time) and increasing duration of residence (observed over time). Of crucial importance, we contrast the changes over time for native and foreign-born residents passing through the same age range from 1995 to 2005. Misconclusions of previous research stem from 1) assuming that any change for immigrants equates to assimilation, without regard to native-born change, and 2) an unbalanced analysis that fails to track in parallel the growing obesity of both immigrant and native-born cohorts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To increase participation in physical activity, it is important to understand the factors associated with a child's choice to be physically active or sedentary. The neighborhood and home environments may be related to this choice. PURPOSE: To determine whether the neighborhood environment or number of televisions in the home environment are independently associated with child physical activity and television time. METHODS: The associations of the neighborhood and home environments on active and sedentary behaviors were studied in 44 boys and 44 girls who wore accelerometers and recorded their television watching behaviors. Neighborhood environment variables were measured using extensive geographic information systems analysis. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses were used to predict physical activity after controlling for individual differences in age, socioeconomic status, percentage overweight, and time the accelerometer was worn in Step 1. Sex of the child was added in Step 2. A neighborhood design variable, street connectivity, accounted for an additional 6{\%} (p <or= .01) of the variability in physical activity in Step 3. A block of variables including a measure of neighborhood land use diversity, percentage park area, and the interaction of Percentage Park Area x Sex then accounted for a further 9{\%} (p <or= .01) of the variability in physical activity in Step 4. Increased access to parks was related to increased physical activity in boys but not in girls. The number of televisions in the home accounted for 6{\%} (p <or= .05) of the variability in television watching behavior. Neighborhood environment variables did not predict television watching that occurs in the home. CONCLUSION: The neighborhood environment is more strongly associated with physical activity of boys than girls. Sedentary behaviors are associated with access to television in the home environment. To promote physical activity in children, planners need to design environments that support active living and parents should limit access to television viewing in the home.},

@article{Cummins2007,
abstract = {Epidemiology, sociology, and geography have been successful in re-establishing interest in the role of place in shaping health and health inequalities. However, some of the relevant empirical research has relied on rather conventional conceptions of space and place and focused on isolating the "independent" contribution of place-level and individual-level factors. This approach may have resulted in an underestimate of the contribution of 'place' to disease risk. In this paper we argue the case for extensive (quantitative) as well as intensive (qualitative) empirical, as well as theoretical, research on health variation that incorporates 'relational', views of space and place. Specifically, we argue that research in place and health should avoid the false dualism of context and composition by recognising that there is a mutually reinforcing and reciprocal relationship between people and place. We explore in the discussion how these theoretical perspectives are beginning to influence empirical research. We argue that these approaches to understanding how place relates to health are important in order to deliver effective, 'contextually sensitive' policy interventions.},

(1) The over burdened health care system will face a worldwide wave of retirees who will live longer, cost more to treat, and demand new goods and services to help them stay healthy, active, and independent. Research in persuasive technologies and the associated usage of a computing system, device, or application intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior in a predetermined way is showing the potential to assist in improving healthy living, reduce the costs on the health care system, and allow the aged to maintain a more independent life. This article gives a deeper insight into the evolution of persuasive technologies and presents a framework that can guide a researcher or practitioner in comprehending more effectively the work being done in this novel research field. It also provides categories of domains within health care in which these technologies are used and surveys exemplars from published literature. The article's goal is to provide greater understanding by addressing the challenges that lie ahead for all key stakeholders that design and/or use persuasive technologies in health care.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:: The use of movement monitors (accelerometers) for measuring physical activity (PA) in intervention and population-based studies is becoming a standard methodology for the objective measurement of sedentary and active behaviors and for validation of subjective PA self-reports. A vital step in PA measurements is classification of daily time into accelerometer wear and nonwear intervals using its recordings (counts) and an accelerometer-specific algorithm. PURPOSE:: To validate and improve a commonly used algorithm for classifying accelerometer wear and nonwear time intervals using objective movement data obtained in the whole-room indirect calorimeter. METHODS:: We conducted a validation study of a wear/nonwear automatic algorithm using data obtained from 49 adults and 76 youth wearing accelerometers during a strictly monitored 24-h stay in a room calorimeter. The accelerometer wear and nonwear time classified by the algorithm was compared with actual wearing time. Potential improvements to the algorithm were examined using the minimum classification error as an optimization target. RESULTS:: The recommended elements in the new algorithm are: 1) zero-count threshold during a nonwear time interval, 2) 90-min time window for consecutive zero/nonzero counts, and 3) allowance of 2-min interval of nonzero counts with the up/downstream 30-min consecutive zero counts window for detection of artifactual movements. Compared to the true wearing status, improvements to the algorithm decreased nonwear time misclassification during the waking and the 24-h periods (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:: The accelerometer wear/nonwear time algorithm improvements may lead to more accurate estimation of time spent in sedentary and active behaviors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study examined the association between objectively measured sedentary activity and metabolic syndrome among older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were from 1,367 men and women, aged ≥60 years who participated in the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Sedentary time during waking hours was measured by an accelerometer (<100 counts per minute). A sedentary bout was defined as a period of time >5 min. A sedentary break was defined as an interruption in sedentary time (≥100 counts per minute). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria. RESULTS On average, people spent 9.5 h (65{\%} of wear time) as sedentary. Compared with people without metabolic syndrome, people with metabolic syndrome spent a greater percentage of time as sedentary (67.3 vs. 62.2{\%}), had longer average sedentary bouts (17.7 vs. 16.7 min), had lower intensity during sedentary time (14.8 vs. 15.8 average counts per minute), and had fewer sedentary breaks (82.3 vs. 86.7), adjusted for age and sex (all P < 0.01). A higher percentage of time sedentary and fewer sedentary breaks were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of metabolic syndrome after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, BMI, diabetes, heart disease, and physical activity. The association between intensity during sedentary time and metabolic syndrome was borderline significant. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of sedentary time was strongly related to metabolic risk, independent of physical activity. Current results suggest older people may benefit from reducing total sedentary time and avoiding prolonged periods of sedentary time by increasing the number of breaks during sedentary time.},

Steps taken during the intervention phase (M = 1,956 steps) were 47{\%} higher than in baseline (M = 1,326 steps), and the percentage of recess spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was higher during intervention (M = 25{\%}) than in baseline (M = 4{\%}). These methods successfully increased steps during recess and could be used to increase steps in other settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health education programs for promoting a healthful diet have shown limited success in clinical trials. PURPOSE: This paper aims to examine whether an innovative educational course focused on societal-level issues related to food and food production (Food and Society) would promote healthful eating among college students. METHODS: A quasi-experimental non-RCT was conducted to compare changes in eating behaviors among students taking the Food and Society course (n=28) versus students taking health-related human biology courses about obesity, health psychology, and community health assessment (n=72). All participants were undergraduates. A Food Frequency Questionnaire was administered at the beginning and end of the four courses taught from January through March 2009. Students in the Food and Society course read selected portions of popular books and essays (e.g., Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma) and watched documentaries (e.g., Aaron Woolf's King Corn) highlighting environmental, ethical, social justice, cultural, political, and agricultural issues related to food and food production, and discussed these major themes during class sessions. In addition, students were required to (1) write an Op-Ed article and (2) create a brief YouTube video focused on themes discussed in the course. RESULTS: The students who took the Food and Society course reported significantly improving their healthful eating (F2, 97=5.72, p=0.02), with greatest improvements in increased vegetable (F2, 97=10.96, p=0.001) and decreased high-fat dairy (F2, 97=5.39, p=0.02) intakes relative to the comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that it may be possible to change dietary behaviors in college students by focusing on social, ethical, cultural, and environmental issues related to food and food production.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Drawing from self-determination theory, this study investigated adults' perceptions of the process of long-term maintenance of physical activity and how it may relate to their self-identity.

DESIGN: Qualitative study included 22 in-depth interviews and participants' recorded personal reflective journals.

SETTING: Health/fitness facility in a Midwestern city.

PARTICIPANTS: Purposeful sample of 12 adult (age range 29-73 years) members who had engaged in regular physical activity for at least 3 years.

METHODS: Data were collected on participants' perceptions of processes associated with physical activity maintenance. Grounded theory data analysis techniques were used to develop an understanding of participants' long-term physical activity adherence. RESULTS. Analysis revealed three themes organized around basic psychological need satisfaction: (1) Relatedness included receiving and giving support. (2) Competence included challenge and competition, managing weight, and strategies for health management. (3) Autonomy included confidence in the established routine, valuing fitness status, and feeling self-directed. The final theme of physically active self included the personal fit of an active lifestyle, identity as an active person, and attachment to physical activity as life enhancing.

CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that long-term physical activity adherence may be strengthened by promotion of the individual's basic psychological need satisfaction. Adherence is most likely to occur when the value of participation becomes internalized over time as a component of the physically active self.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the recent explosion of the mobile health (mHealth) industry and consumer acquisition of mHealth tools such as wearable sensors and applications (apps), limited information is known about how this technology can sustain health behavior change and be integrated into health care.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to understand potential users' views of mHealth technology, the role this technology may have in promoting individual activity goals aimed at improving health, and the value of integrating mHealth technology with traditional health care.

METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with adults interested in sharing their views on how mHealth technology could support wellness programs and improve health. Participants (n=30) were enrolled from an employee population at an academic health institution. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to code transcripts and identify overarching themes.

RESULTS: Our findings suggest that tracking health data alone may result in heightened awareness of daily activity, yet may not be sufficient to sustain use of mHealth technology and apps, which often have low reuse rates. Participants suggested that context, meaning, and health care partnerships need to be incorporated to engage and retain users. In addition to these findings, drivers for mHealth technology previously identified in the literature, including integration and control of health data were confirmed in this study.

CONCLUSIONS: This study explores ways that mHealth technologies may be used to not only track data, but to encourage sustained engagement to achieve individual health goals. Implications of these findings include recommendations for mHealth technology design and health care partnership models to sustain motivation and engagement, allowing individuals to achieve meaningful behavior change.},

We conducted 14 adolescent focus groups (n = 119), 8 parent focus groups (n = 63), and 28 interviews with community members (i.e., local experts knowledgeable about youth nutrition and physical activity). Participants described ecological and psychosocial barriers in neighborhoods (e.g., lack of accessible nutritious food), in schools (e.g., poor quality of physical education), at home (e.g., sedentary lifestyle), and at the individual level (e.g., lack of nutrition knowledge). Participants proposed interventions such as nutrition classes for families, addition of healthy school food options that appeal to students, and non-competitive physical education activities. Participants supported health education delivered by students. Findings demonstrate that community-based participatory research is useful for revealing potentially feasible interventions that are acceptable to community members.},

FINDINGS: Participants wore a Fitbit Zip, ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer and a Yamax CW700 pedometer for seven days. Participants were asked their opinion on the utility of the Fitbit Zip. Validity was assessed by comparing the output using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Bland-Altman plots. 59.5{\%} (25/47) of the cohort were female. There was a high correlation in steps/day between the Fitbit Zip and the two reference devices (r = 0.91, p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference between the Fitbit and Yamax steps/day was observed (Median (IQR) 7477 (3597) vs 6774 (3851); p = 0.11). The Fitbit measured significantly more steps/day than the Actigraph (7477 (3597) vs 6774 (3851); p < 0.001). Bland-Altman plots revealed no systematic differences between the devices.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although a criterion reference of 10,000 steps per day is recommended for health benefits, a literature search yielded no normative standard for daily steps. Therefore, a meta-analysis was used to estimate the number of pedometer-documented steps that adults take daily.

METHODS: Studies were retrieved using electronic databases and cross-referencing from retrieved studies. A random-effects model and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were used for all analyses of daily step data.

RESULTS: Seventy-one outcomes, representing 6,199 subjects from 42 studies, met the inclusion criteria. Excluding Amish subjects, the daily step count averaged 9,448 (95{\%} CI=8,899-9,996) and was greater in subjects younger than 65 years of age (mean=9,797, 95{\%} CI=9,216-10,377) compared with subjects 65 years of age or older (mean=6,565, 95{\%} CI=4,897-8,233).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study provides an estimate of the number of daily steps taken by adults. The number is less than the recommended 10,000 steps per day and is especially low in adults 65 years of age or older.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of two Internet-based weight loss interventions on physical activity (PA) and dietary behaviors using two approaches for computing combined behavior change. METHOD: Participants were 352 overweight/obese women and men completing 12-month interventions in San Diego, California during 2002-2007. Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and sedentary time were measured with accelerometers, and dietary fat and fruit and vegetable intake were assessed with food frequency questionnaires. Longitudinal analyses tested the effect of the intervention on combined health behavior change quantified using a standardized residualized change index (SRCI) and a risk factor change index (RFCI). RESULTS: At baseline, participants engaged in an average of 153min/week of MVPA and 525min/day of sedentary time, and consumed 37{\%} of calories from fat and <3 fruits and vegetables per day. The interventions had a significant effect on combined behavior change as measured with each approach (p<0.001). The intervention effect was larger (p<0.001) when evaluated using the SRCI (standardized regression coefficient [Beta]=0.30) than the RFCI ($\beta$=-0.18). CONCLUSION: Interventions that target both PA and dietary behaviors appear effective. The SRCI was more sensitive for evaluating the intervention, but the RFCI may be easier to use for communicating public health significance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Psychosocial and health behaviour treatments and therapies can be extended beyond traditional research or clinical settings by using mobile technology to deliver interventions to individuals as they go about their daily lives. These ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are treatments that are provided to people during their everyday lives (i.e. in real time) and in natural settings (i.e. real world). The goal of the present review is to synthesize and critique mobile technology-based EMI aimed at improving health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-seven interventions using palmtop computers or mobile phones to deliver ambulatory treatment for smoking cessation, weight loss, anxiety, diabetes management, eating disorders, alcohol use, and healthy eating and physical activity were identified. RESULTS: There is evidence that EMI can be successfully delivered, are accepted by patients, and are efficacious for treating a variety of health behaviours and physical and psychological symptoms. Limitations of the existing literature were identified and recommendations and considerations for research design, sample characteristics, measurement, statistical analyses, and clinical implementation are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile technology-based EMI can be effectively implemented as interventions for a variety of health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms. Future research should integrate the assessment and intervention capabilities of mobile technology to create dynamically and individually tailored EMI that are ecologically sensitive.},

A total of 21 such interventions were found from Australia (1), Austria (1), Canada (1), Chile (1), France (1), Germany (3), Greece (1), New Zealand (1), Norway (1), Singapore (1) and the United Kingdom (9). The grade range of these interventions was from pre-school to high school with the majority (17) from elementary schools. Nine of these interventions targeted nutrition behaviours followed by seven aiming to modify both physical activity and nutrition behaviours. Only five interventions in international settings were based on any explicit behavioural theory which is different than the interventions developed in the United States. Majority of the interventions (9) were one academic year long. It can be speculated that if the interventions are behavioural theory-based, then the intervention length can be shortened. All interventions that documented parental involvement successfully influenced obesity indices. Most interventions (16) focused on individual-level behaviour change approaches. Most published interventions (16) used experimental designs with at least 1-year follow-up. Recommendations from international settings for enhancing the effectiveness of school-based childhood obesity interventions are presented.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In order to quantify the effects of physical activity such as walking on chronic disease, accurate measurement of physical activity is needed. The objective of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of a new activity monitor, the Fitbit One, in a population of healthy adults.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.

METHODS: Thirty healthy adults ambulated at 5 different speeds (0.90, 1.12, 1.33, 1.54, 1.78 m/s) on a treadmill while wearing three Fitbit One activity monitors (two on the hips and one in the pocket). The order of each speed condition was randomized. Fitbit One step count output was compared to observer counts and distance output was compared to the calibrated treadmill output. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, concordance correlation coefficients, and Bland and Altman plots were used to assess validity and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess reliability.

RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between Fitbit One step count outputs and observer counts, and concordance was substantial (0.97-1.00). Inter-device reliability of the step count was high for all walking speeds (ICC ≥ 0.95). Percent relative error was less than 1.3{\%}. The distance output of the Fitbit One activity monitors was significantly different from the criterion values for each monitor at all speeds (P<0.001) and exhibited poor concordance (0.0-0.05). Inter-device reliability was excellent for all treadmill speeds (ICC ≥ 0.90). Percent relative error was high (up to 39.6{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS: The Fitbit One activity monitors are valid and reliable devices for measuring step counts in healthy young adults. The distance output of the monitors is inaccurate and should be noted with caution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying leisure time activities performed before and after school that influence time in physical activity (PA) and/or time spent sedentary can provide useful information when designing interventions aimed to promote an active lifestyle in young people. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between mode of transportation to school, outdoor play after school, participation in exercise in clubs, and TV viewing with objectively assessed PA and sedentary behaviour in children. METHODS: A total of 1327 nine- and 15-year-old children from three European countries (Norway, Estonia, Portugal) participated as part of the European Youth Heart Study. PA was measured during two weekdays and two weekend days using the MTI accelerometer, and average percent of time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and time spent sedentary were derived. Potential correlates were assessed by self-report. Independent associations between self-reported correlates with percent time in MVPA and percent time sedentary were analysed by general linear models, adjusted by age, gender, country, measurement period, monitored days and parental socio-economic status. RESULTS: In 9-year-olds, playing outdoors after school was associated with higher percent time in MVPA (P < 0.01), while participation in sport clubs was associated with higher percent time in MVPA (P < 0.01) in 15-year-olds. No associations with percent time sedentary were observed in either age group. CONCLUSION: Frequency of outdoor play after school is a significant correlate for daily time in MVPA in 9-year-olds, while this correlate is attenuated in favour of participation in sport and exercise in clubs in 15-year-olds. Targeting walking to school or reduced TV viewing time in order to increase time in daily MVPA in children is unlikely to be sufficient. Correlates related to time spent sedentary need further examination.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The prevalence of obesity increased in the United States between 1976-1980 and 1988-1994 and again between 1988-1994 and 1999-2000. OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in obesity from 1999 through 2008 and the current prevalence of obesity and overweight for 2007-2008. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of height and weight measurements from 5555 adult men and women aged 20 years or older obtained in 2007-2008 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 2007-2008 were compared with results obtained from 1999 through 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults. Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 29.9. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher. RESULTS: In 2007-2008, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 33.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 31.6{\%}-36.0{\%}) overall, 32.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 29.5{\%}-35.0{\%}) among men, and 35.5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 33.2{\%}-37.7{\%}) among women. The corresponding prevalence estimates for overweight and obesity combined (BMI > or = 25) were 68.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 66.3{\%}-69.8{\%}), 72.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 70.4{\%}-74.1{\%}), and 64.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 61.3{\%}-66.9{\%}). Obesity prevalence varied by age group and by racial and ethnic group for both men and women. Over the 10-year period, obesity showed no significant trend among women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.12 [95{\%} CI, 0.89-1.32]). For men, there was a significant linear trend (AOR for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.32 [95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.58]); however, the 3 most recent data points did not differ significantly from each other. CONCLUSIONS: In 2007-2008, the prevalence of obesity was 32.2{\%} among adult men and 35.5{\%} among adult women. The increases in the prevalence of obesity previously observed do not appear to be continuing at the same rate over the past 10 years, particularly for women and possibly for men.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether aerobic fitness and obesity in school children are associated with standardized test performance. STUDY DESIGN: Ethnically diverse (n = 1989) 5th, 7th, and 9th graders attending California schools comprised the sample. Aerobic fitness was determined by a 1-mile run/walk test; body mass index (BMI) was obtained from state-mandated measurements. California standardized test scores were obtained from the school district. RESULTS: Students whose mile run/walk times exceeded California Fitnessgram standards or whose BMI exceeded Centers for Disease Control sex- and age-specific body weight standards scored lower on California standardized math, reading, and language tests than students with desirable BMI status or fitness level, even after controlling for parent education among other covariates. Ethnic differences in standardized test scores were consistent with ethnic differences in obesity status and aerobic fitness. BMI-for-age was no longer a significant multivariate predictor when covariates included fitness level. CONCLUSIONS: Low aerobic fitness is common among youth and varies among ethnic groups, and aerobic fitness level predicts performance on standardized tests across ethnic groups. More research is needed to uncover the physiological mechanisms by which aerobic fitness may contribute to performance on standardized academic tests.},

Global Positioning System (GPS) technology offers potential to improve the measurement of physical activity. This paper 1) reviews the extant literature on the application of GPS to monitor human movement, with a particular emphasis on free-living physical activity, 2) discusses issues associated with GPS use, and 3) provides recommendations for future research. Overall findings show that GPS is a useful tool to augment our understanding of physical activity by providing the context (location) of the activity and used together with Geographical Information Systems can provide some insight into how people interact with the environment. However, no studies have shown that GPS alone is a reliable and valid measure of physical activity.},

This is a review of the theoretical basis and interactivity of mobile health behavior interventions. Many of the mobile health behavior interventions reviewed were predominately one way (i.e., mostly data input or informational output), but some have leveraged mobile technologies to provide just-in-time, interactive, and adaptive interventions. Most smoking and weight loss studies reported a theoretical basis for the mobile intervention, but most of the adherence and disease management studies did not. Mobile health behavior intervention development could benefit from greater application of health behavior theories. Current theories, however, appear inadequate to inform mobile intervention development as these interventions become more interactive and adaptive. Dynamic feedback system theories of health behavior can be developed utilizing longitudinal data from mobile devices and control systems engineering models.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is little epidemiologic research on longitudinal and secular trends in weight-related health behaviors throughout the stages of adolescence. In particular, few data are available to assess secular trends in various sedentary behaviors. The objective of this research was to investigate longitudinal and secular trends in physical activity and sedentary behavior in a large, diverse cohort of adolescents. METHODS: Project EAT-II is a 5-year longitudinal study (N = 2516) that includes 2 cohorts that allow for the observation of longitudinal changes from early to midadolescence (junior high to high school; n = 806; mean baseline age: 12.8 +/- 0.8 years) and mid- to late adolescence (high school to post-high school; n = 1710; mean baseline age: 15.8 +/- 0.8 years). EAT-II also examined secular trends in health behavior from 1999 to 2004 in midadolescence. The main outcome measures of the mixed-model regression analyses used in this research were self-reported weekly hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity, television/video viewing, and leisure-time computer use. RESULTS: Our findings indicate substantial longitudinal changes in moderate to vigorous physical activity, particularly among girls (decreasing 5.9-4.9 hours/week from early to midadolescence and 5.1-3.5 hours/week from mid- to late adolescence), and leisure-time computer use, particularly among boys (increasing 11.4-15.2 hours/week from early to midadolescence and 10.4-14.2 hours/week from mid- to late adolescence). Secular trends further indicate dramatic increases in midadolescent computer use from 1999 to 2004; girls increased from 8.8 to 11.1 hours/week, and boys increased from 10.4 to 15.2 hours/week. CONCLUSIONS: These adolescents experienced unfavorable shifts in activity patterns, such as longitudinal decreases in moderate to vigorous physical activity, coupled with longitudinal and secular increases in leisure-time computer use. Developing effective health promotion strategies that address a wide array of changing behavioral patterns will be important in promoting long-term health and active lifestyles among adolescents and young adults.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advancements in mobile phone technology have led to the development of smartphones with the capability to run apps. The availability of a plethora of health- and fitness-related smartphone apps has the potential, both on a clinical and public health level, to facilitate healthy behavior change and weight management. However, current top-rated apps in this area have not been extensively evaluated in terms of scientific quality and behavioral theory evidence base.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of the most popular dietary weight-loss smartphone apps on the commercial market using comprehensive quality assessment criteria, and to quantify the behavior change techniques (BCTs) incorporated.

METHODS: The top 200-rated Health {\&} Fitness category apps from the free and paid sections of Google Play and iTunes App Store in Australia (n=800) were screened in August 2014. To be included in further analysis, an app had to focus on weight management, include a facility to record diet intake (self-monitoring), and be in English. One researcher downloaded and used the eligible apps thoroughly for 5 days and assessed the apps against quality assessment criteria which included the following domains: accountability, scientific coverage and content accuracy of information relevant to weight management, technology-enhanced features, usability, and incorporation of BCTs. For inter-rater reliability purposes, a second assessor provided ratings on 30{\%} of the apps. The accuracy of app energy intake calculations was further investigated by comparison with results from a 3-day weighed food record (WFR).

RESULTS: Across the eligible apps reviewed (n=28), only 1 app (4{\%}) received full marks for accountability. Overall, apps included an average of 5.1 (SD 2.3) out of 14 technology-enhanced features, and received a mean score of 13.5 (SD 3.7) out of 20 for usability. The majority of apps provided estimated energy requirements (24/28, 86{\%}) and used a food database to calculate energy intake (21/28, 75{\%}). When compared against the WFR, the mean absolute energy difference of apps which featured energy intake calculations (23/28, 82{\%}) was 127 kJ (95{\%} CI -45 to 299). An average of 6.3 (SD 3.7) of 26 BCTs were included.

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the most popular commercial apps for weight management are suboptimal in quality, given the inadequate scientific coverage and accuracy of weight-related information, and the relative absence of BCTs across the apps reviewed. With the limited regulatory oversight around the quality of these types of apps, this evaluation provides clinicians and consumers an informed view of the highest-quality apps in the current popular app pool appropriate for recommendation and uptake. Further research is necessary to assess the effectiveness of apps for weight management.},

abstract = {This is a three-part study that examined the accuracy of five brands of electronic pedometers (Freestyle Pacer, Eddie Bauer, L.L. Bean, Yamax, and Accusplit) under a variety of different conditions. In Part I, 20 subjects walked a 4.88-km sidewalk course while wearing two devices of the same brand (on the left and right side of the body) for each of five different trials. There were significant differences among pedometers (P < 0.05), with the Yamax, Pacer, and Accusplit approximating the actual distance more closely than the other models. The Yamax pedometers showed close agreement, but the left and right Pacer pedometers differed significantly (P = 0.0003) and the Accusplit displayed a similar trend (P = 0.0657). In Part II, the effects of walking surface on pedometer accuracy were examined. Ten of the original subjects completed an additional five trials around a 400-m rubberized outdoor track. The devices showed similar values for sidewalk and track surfaces. In Part III, the effects of walking speed on pedometer accuracy were examined. Ten different subjects walked on a treadmill at various speeds (54, 67, 80, 94, and 107 m.min-1). Pedometers that displayed both distance and number of steps were examined. The Yamax was more accurate than the Pacer and Eddie Bauer at slow-to-moderate speeds (P < 0.05), though no significant differences were seen at the fastest speed. While there are variations among brands in terms of accuracy, electronic pedometers may prove useful in recording walking activities in free-living populations.},

abstract = {Obesity represents a strong risk factor for developing chronic diseases. Strategies for disease prevention often promote lifestyle changes encouraging participation in physical activity. However, determining what amount of physical activity is necessary for achieving specific health benefits has been hampered by the lack of accurate instruments for monitoring physical activity and the related physiological outcomes. This review aims at presenting recent advances in activity-monitoring technology and their application to support interventions for health promotion. Activity monitors have evolved from step counters and measuring devices of physical activity duration and intensity to more advanced systems providing quantitative and qualitative information on the individuals' activity behavior. Correspondingly, methods to predict activity-related energy expenditure using bodily acceleration and subjects characteristics have advanced from linear regression to innovative algorithms capable of determining physical activity types and the related metabolic costs. These novel techniques can monitor modes of sedentary behavior as well as the engagement in specific activity types that helps to evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. In conclusion, advances in activity monitoring have the potential to support the design of response-dependent physical activity recommendations that are needed to generate effective and personalized lifestyle interventions for health promotion.International Journal of Obesity advance online publication, 17 May 2011; doi:10.1038/ijo.2011.99.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many smartphone applications (apps) for weight loss are available, but little is known about their effectiveness.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of introducing primary care patients to a free smartphone app for weight loss.

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01650337).

SETTING: 2 academic primary care clinics.

PATIENTS: 212 primary care patients with body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater.

INTERVENTION: 6 months of usual care without (n = 107) or with (n = 105) assistance in downloading the MyFitnessPal app (MyFitnessPal).

MEASUREMENTS: Weight loss at 6 months (primary outcome) and changes in systolic blood pressure and behaviors, frequency of app use, and satisfaction (secondary outcomes).

RESULTS: After 6 months, weight change was minimal, with no difference between groups (mean between-group difference, -0.30 kg [95{\%} CI, -1.50 to 0.95 kg]; P = 0.63). Change in systolic blood pressure also did not differ between groups (mean between-group difference, -1.7 mm Hg [CI, -7.1 to 3.8 mm Hg]; P = 0.55). Compared with patients in the control group, those in the intervention group increased use of a personal calorie goal (mean between-group difference, 2.0 d/wk [CI, 1.1 to 2.9 d/wk]; P < 0.001), although other self-reported behaviors did not differ between groups. Most users reported high satisfaction with MyFitnessPal, but logins decreased sharply after the first month.

LIMITATIONS: Despite being blinded to the name of the app, 14 control group participants (13{\%}) used MyFitnessPal. In addition, 32{\%} of intervention group participants and 19{\%} of control group participants were lost to follow-up at 6 months. The app was given to patients by research assistants, not by physicians.

CONCLUSION: Smartphone apps for weight loss may be useful for persons who are ready to self-monitor calories, but introducing a smartphone app is unlikely to produce substantial weight change for most patients.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore mean food group intakes associated with central obesity anthropometry among children and adolescents enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Representative sampling of the US population (1998-2002). SUBJECTS: Subjects were 3761 children (5-11 years) and 1803 adolescents (12-16 years) with single 24 h dietary recalls and anthropometric measures of central body fat (waist circumference and sum of subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses). RESULTS: Results were controlled for confounding by age, height, race/ethnicity, Tanner stage, television viewing and parental education. In younger children, there was no relationship between central adiposity and mean intakes of dairy, fruit, vegetables or grains, while a positive association with meat intake was found among boys. In adolescent boys and girls, central body fat measures were inversely associated with mean dairy and grain intakes. Adolescent boys in the highest quartile of central adiposity consumed less fruit and fewer vegetables; those in the lowest central adiposity quartile consumed less meat. Finally, adolescents who met the criteria for central obesity (waist circumference >or=85th percentile for age and sex) reported consuming significantly less total dairy (as well as milk and cheese separately), total grains (whole and refined) and total fruit and vegetables. There was no association with meat consumption. To test the stability of these findings, the final analysis was replicated in 2541 same-aged adolescents from NHANES 1999-2002; the results were very similar. CONCLUSIONS: These cross-sectional analyses suggest that intakes of dairy, grains and total fruits and vegetables are inversely associated with central obesity among adolescents.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic and racial-ethnic disparities in health status across the United States are large and persistent. Obesity rates are rising faster in black and Hispanic populations than in white populations, and they foreshadow even greater disparities in chronic illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease in years to come. Factors that influence dietary intake of fruit and vegetables in these populations are only partly understood. OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between fruit and vegetable intake and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), analyzed whether neighborhood SES explains racial differences in intake, and explored the extent to which neighborhood SES has differential effects by race-ethnicity of US adults. DESIGN: Using geocoded residential addresses from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we merged individual-level data with county and census tract-level US Census data. We estimated 3-level hierarchical models predicting fruit and vegetable intake with individual characteristics and an index of neighborhood SES as explanatory variables. RESULTS: Neighborhood SES was positively associated with fruit and vegetable intake: a 1-SD increase in the neighborhood SES index was associated with consumption of nearly 2 additional servings of fruit and vegetables per week. Neighborhood SES explained some of the black-white disparity in fruit and vegetable intake and was differentially associated with fruit and vegetable intake among whites, blacks, and Mexican Americans. CONCLUSIONS: The positive association of neighborhood SES with fruit and vegetable intake is one important pathway through which the social environment of neighborhoods affects population health and nutrition for whites, blacks, and Hispanics in the United States.},

Twenty-three subjects were fitted with two Fitbit and Fitbit Ultra accelerometers, two industry-standard accelerometers and an indirect calorimetry device. Subjects participated in 6-min bouts of treadmill walking, jogging and stair stepping. Results indicate the Fitbit and Fitbit Ultra are reliable and valid for activity monitoring (step counts) and determining energy expenditure while walking and jogging without an incline. The Fitbit and standard accelerometers under-estimated energy expenditure compared to indirect calorimetry for inclined activities. These data suggest the Fitbit and Fitbit Ultra are reliable and valid for monitoring over-ground energy expenditure.},

abstract = {Sedentary behavior and sleep may be working in concert to increase the likelihood of a child becoming overweight, but in paradoxical ways. Reduction of sedentary behavior (that is, media screen time) has been extensively researched and touted as an intervention target. Inadequate sleep as a putative risk factor for obesity is only beginning to be explored. In this paper, we review the current state of research regarding these factors, and describe the existing evidence and mechanisms proposed to explain these relationships. Whereas the association between weight and sedentary behavior has been consistently shown in observational studies, effect sizes are small, and multiple mechanisms appear to be operating. Recent cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence suggests a link between short sleep duration and weight. Possible mechanisms here include direct metabolic effects as well as indirect behavioral pathways, including the presence of electronic media in children's bedrooms. Measurement issues present a challenge to both areas of research. Prospective studies that include more accurate measures of both sedentary behavior and of sleep will be needed to clarify causal pathways.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have provided information on the prevalence and risk factors of low back pain (LBP) in white collar workers in industrialized countries. Little information has related individual, work ergonomic, and psychosocial factors to the incidence of LBP in low income countries. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of LBP among Greek public office workers. To identify and relate the individual, work ergonomic, and psychosocial factors to the occurrence of LBP. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of Greek office workers in the public sector. METHODS: A self-reported standardized questionnaire was constructed to record risk factors associated with the occurrence of LBP. Personal characteristics, work ergonomics, and psychosocial traits were collected and related to LBP prevalence. RESULTS: Of the 771 office workers, 648 responded (84{\%} return rate). The majority of the participants were women (75.8{\%}). Among all responders, 33{\%}, 37.8{\%}, 41.8{\%}, and 61.6{\%} presented with point, one-year, two-year, and lifetime prevalence respectively. Sleep disturbances due to pain were reported in 37{\%} of the office clerks with chronic low back pain. Multiple logistic regression models have revealed that significant determinants for predicting LBP occurrence are age, gender, body mass index, body distance from computer screen, adjustable back support, clerk body position while sitting, sitting time of greater than 6 hours, job satisfaction, repetitive work, and anger during last 30 days. CONCLUSION: High proportions of Greek office workers suffer from LBP which might affect the Greek economy. The incidence of LBP status is significantly associated with some anthropometric, ergonomic, and psychosocial factors.},

abstract = {Approximately one-third of adults in the United States are physically inactive. This is a significant public health concern as physical activity (PA) can influence the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer. To minimize these health risks, effective PA interventions must be developed and disseminated to the vast number of individuals who remain sedentary. Smartphone technology presents an exciting opportunity for delivering PA interventions remotely. Although a number of PA applications are currently available for smartphones, these "apps" are not based on established theories of health behavior change and most do not include evidence-based features (e.g., reinforcement and goal setting). Our aim was to collect formative data to develop a smartphone PA app that is empirically and theoretically-based and incorporates user preferences. We recruited 15 sedentary adults to test three currently available PA smartphone apps and provide qualitative and quantitative feedback. Findings indicate that users have a number of specific preferences with regard to PA app features, including that apps provide automatic tracking of PA (e.g., steps taken and calories burned), track progress toward PA goals, and integrate a music feature. Participants also preferred that PA apps be flexible enough to be used with several types of PA, and have well-documented features and user-friendly interfaces (e.g., a one-click main page). When queried by the researcher, most participants endorsed including goal-setting and problem-solving features. These findings provide a blue print for developing a smartphone PA app that incorporates evidence-based components and user preferences.},

abstract = {Overweight and obesity has doubled among children in Australia. There is an urgent need to develop primary prevention strategies to prevent current and future unhealthy weight gain. The aims of this paper are to describe a randomized controlled trial ('Switch-Play') developed to prevent unhealthy weight gain among 10-year-old children and to report the findings of the process evaluation. Children from three government primary schools were randomized by class to one of four conditions: a behavioural modification group (BM; n = 69); a fundamental motor skills group (FMS; n = 73); a combined BM and FMS group (n = 90); or a control (usual classroom lessons) group (n = 61). Children in the BM group participated in 19 sessions that encouraged them to reduce screen-based behaviours, and identified physical activity alternatives. The FMS group participated in 19 lessons that focused on mastery of six skills: run, throw, dodge, strike, vertical jump and kick. The combined group participated in all the BM and FMS activities. The intervention specialist teacher reported that the children showed high enjoyment and engagement (88{\%} lessons attended) in most aspects of the programme. At-home tasks were completed by 57-62{\%} of the children, and 92{\%} completed the in-class tasks. Two-thirds of the children in the BM group participated in the behavioural contracting to switch off the TV. Most of the children reported high enjoyment of the programmes, and only a small proportion (7-17{\%}) reported difficulties in switching off their nominated TV shows. More than half the children reported reducing their TV viewing; however, less than half reported increasing their physical activity. It was found that most aspects of the intervention arms of the programme were successfully delivered to the majority of children participating in 'Switch-Play'; that the programmes were delivered as intended; and that the programmes were favourably evaluated by participating children and their parents.},

This systematic review provides an overview of behavior change interventions for disease management and prevention delivered through text messaging.

Only those interventions using text message as the primary mode of communication were included. Study quality was assessed by using a standardized measure. Seventeen articles representing 12 studies (5 disease prevention and 7 disease management) were included. Intervention length ranged from 3 months to 12 months, none had long-term follow-up, and message frequency varied. Of 9 sufficiently powered studies, 8 found evidence to support text messaging as a tool for behavior change. Effects exist across age, minority status, and nationality. Nine countries are represented in this review, but it is problematic that only one is a developing country, given potential benefits of such a widely accessible, relatively inexpensive tool for health behavior change. Methodological issues and gaps in the literature are highlighted, and recommendations for future studies are provided.},

abstract = {This review of the epidemiological evidence regarding physical activity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) provides substantial evidence from many different populations that leisure time physical activity is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular mortality in both men and women and in middle-aged and older individuals. Physical activity appears to be a critical factor in both primary and secondary prevention of CHD. The studies indicate a dose-response relationship between overall physical activity and CVD, which is linear at least up to a certain level of activity. Prospective studies suggest that physical activity is also associated with reduced risk of stroke. The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of physical activity on CVD are still unclear. In recent years, the view that physical activity has to be vigorous to achieve a reduction in risk of CHD has been questioned. Overall, the evidence points to the benefit of continued regular moderate physical activity which does not need to be strenuous or prolonged and includes daily leisure activities such as walking or gardening which are readily attainable by large sections of the population. Taking up regular light or moderate physical activity in middle or older age confers significant benefit for CVD and all-cause mortality.},

Broad recommendations are offered in five areas: (1) theoretical and conceptual development in framing place effects on health; (2) contextualizing people and spatial behavior in built environments and improving empirical representations of place; (3) geospatial data availability, quality, and standards; (4) privacy and confidentiality; and, (5) building capacity in GIS personnel and infrastructure. These topics are inter-related. Although our discussion focuses on issues relevant to the role of the built environment in diet and physical activity outcomes, our recommendations also are salient to health and environment research generally.},

abstract = {Driven by the demands on healthcare resulting from the shift toward more sedentary lifestyles, considerable effort has been devoted to the monitoring and classification of human activity. In previous studies, various classification schemes and feature extraction methods have been used to identify different activities from a range of different datasets. In this paper, we present a comparison of 14 methods to extract classification features from accelerometer signals. These are based on the wavelet transform and other well-known time- and frequency-domain signal characteristics. To allow an objective comparison between the different features, we used two datasets of activities collected from 20 subjects. The first set comprised three commonly used activities, namely, level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent, and the second a total of eight activities. Furthermore, we compared the classification accuracy for each feature set across different combinations of three different accelerometer placements. The classification analysis has been performed with robust subject-based cross-validation methods using a nearest-neighbor classifier. The findings show that, although the wavelet transform approach can be used to characterize nonstationary signals, it does not perform as accurately as frequency-based features when classifying dynamic activities performed by healthy subjects.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concurrent validity of Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS) items was evaluated with objective measures of the built environment using geographic information systems (GIS). METHODS: A sample of 878 parents of children 10 to 16 years old (mean age 43.5 years, SD = 6.8, 34.8{\%} non-White, 63.8{\%} overweight) completed NEWS and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. GIS was used to develop 1-mile street network buffers around participants' residences. GIS measures of the built environment within participants' buffers included percent of commercial and institutional land uses; number of schools and colleges, recreational facilities, parks, transit stops, and trees; land topography; and traffic congestion. RESULTS: Except for trees and traffic, concordance between the NEWS and GIS measures were significant, with weak to moderate effect sizes (r = -0.09 to -0.36, all P < or = 01). After participants were stratified by physical activity level, stronger concordance was observed among active participants for some measures. A sensitivity analysis of self-reported distance to 15 neighborhood destinations found a 20-minute (compared with 10- or 30-minute) walking threshold generally had the strongest correlations with GIS measures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence of the concurrent validity of self-reported built environment items with objective measures. Physically active adults may be more knowledgeable about their neighborhood characteristics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: During a behavioral weight loss program (BWLP), weight loss and exercise can vary considerably from week to week. Weekly fluctuations in outcome expectancies and perceived difficulties with eating and exercise may be associated with weekly variability in weight loss and exercise. Also, inconsistent self-monitoring of exercise may be associated with poor weight loss and physical activity treatment outcomes.

METHODS: Forty obese, sedentary participants completed a 6-month BWLP. Body weight, outcome expectancies, and difficulties with eating and exercise were assessed weekly. Weekly self-monitoring of exercise was computed from physical activity diaries. Physical activity, VO2max, and caloric intake were assessed pre- and posttreatment.

RESULTS: Within-subjects analyses indicated that participants exercised less during weeks that participants reported greater difficulties with exercise, relative to weeks participants reported fewer difficulties. Participants lost significantly more weight during weeks that participants reported more positive outcome expectancies and greater difficulties with exercise, compared to weeks participants reported less positive outcome expectancies and fewer difficulties with exercise. Consistent self-monitoring of exercise was associated with fewer difficulties with exercise and greater exercise and weight loss.

CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that are targeted to increase self-monitoring and to improve transient difficulties with exercise and diminished outcome expectancies may improve BWLP treatment outcomes.},

abstract = {Healthcare providers are often looking for ways to objectively monitor and improve their patients' health and fitness, especially in between patient visits. Some insurance companies are using applications data as incentives to improve health and lower premiums. As more and more people start to use smartphones, they may provide a tool to help improve a patient's health and fitness. Specifically, fitness applications or "apps" on smartphones are programs that use data collected from a smartphone's inbuilt tools, such as the Global Positioning System, accelerometer, microphone, speaker, and camera, to measure health and fitness parameters. The apps then analyze these data and summarize them, as well as devise individualized plans based on users' goals, provide frequent feedback, personalized coaching, and additional motivation by allowing milestones to be shared on social media. This article introduces evidence that apps can better help patients reach their health and fitness goals. It then discusses what features to look for in an app, followed by an overview of popular health and fitness apps. Last, patient scenarios with app recommendations, limitations of apps, and future research are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic activity monitors (such as those manufactured by Fitbit, Jawbone, and Nike) improve on standard pedometers by providing automated feedback and interactive behavior change tools via mobile device or personal computer. These monitors are commercially popular and show promise for use in public health interventions. However, little is known about the content of their feedback applications and how individual monitors may differ from one another.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the behavior change techniques implemented in commercially available electronic activity monitors.

METHODS: Electronic activity monitors (N=13) were systematically identified and tested by 3 trained coders for at least 1 week each. All monitors measured lifestyle physical activity and provided feedback via an app (computer or mobile). Coding was based on a hierarchical list of 93 behavior change techniques. Further coding of potentially effective techniques and adherence to theory-based recommendations were based on findings from meta-analyses and meta-regressions in the research literature.

RESULTS: All monitors provided tools for self-monitoring, feedback, and environmental change by definition. The next most prevalent techniques (13 out of 13 monitors) were goal-setting and emphasizing discrepancy between current and goal behavior. Review of behavioral goals, social support, social comparison, prompts/cues, rewards, and a focus on past success were found in more than half of the systems. The monitors included a range of 5-10 of 14 total techniques identified from the research literature as potentially effective. Most of the monitors included goal-setting, self-monitoring, and feedback content that closely matched recommendations from social cognitive theory.

CONCLUSIONS: Electronic activity monitors contain a wide range of behavior change techniques typically used in clinical behavioral interventions. Thus, the monitors may represent a medium by which these interventions could be translated for widespread use. This technology has broad applications for use in clinical, public health, and rehabilitation settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical Activity Across the Curriculum (PAAC) was a three-year cluster randomized controlled trial to promote physical activity and diminish increases in overweight and obesity in elementary school children. METHODS: Twenty-four elementary schools were cluster randomized to the Physical Activity Across the Curriculum intervention or served as control. All children in grades two and three were followed to grades four and five. Physical Activity Across the Curriculum promoted 90 min/wk of moderate to vigorous intensity physically active academic lessons delivered by classroom teachers. Body Mass Index was the primary outcome, daily Physical activity and academic achievement were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The three-year change in Body Mass Index for Physical Activity Across the Curriculum was 2.0+/-1.9 and control 1.9+/-1.9, respectively (NS). However, change in Body Mass Index from baseline to 3 years was significantly influenced by exposure to Physical Activity Across the Curriculum. Schools with > or =75 min of Physical Activity Across the Curriculum/wk showed significantly less increase in Body Mass Index at 3 years compared to schools that had <75 min of Physical Activity Across the Curriculum (1.8+/-1.8 vs. 2.4+/-2.0, p=0.02). Physical Activity Across the Curriculum schools had significantly greater changes in daily Physical activity and academic achievement scores. CONCLUSIONS: The Physical Activity Across the Curriculum approach may promote daily Physical activity and academic achievement in elementary school children. Additionally, 75 min of Physical Activity Across the Curriculum activities may attenuate increases in Body Mass Index.},

FINDINGS: Participants wore a Fitbit Zip, ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer and a Yamax CW700 pedometer for seven days. Participants were asked their opinion on the utility of the Fitbit Zip. Validity was assessed by comparing the output using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients, Wilcoxon signed rank tests and Bland-Altman plots. 59.5{\%} (25/47) of the cohort were female. There was a high correlation in steps/day between the Fitbit Zip and the two reference devices (r = 0.91, p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference between the Fitbit and Yamax steps/day was observed (Median (IQR) 7477 (3597) vs 6774 (3851); p = 0.11). The Fitbit measured significantly more steps/day than the Actigraph (7477 (3597) vs 6774 (3851); p < 0.001). Bland-Altman plots revealed no systematic differences between the devices.

CONCLUSIONS: Given the high level of correlation and no apparent systematic biases in the Bland Altman plots, the use of Fitbit Zip as a measure of physical activity. However the Fitbit Zip recorded a significantly higher number of steps per day than the Actigraph.},

Design and Sample Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted following a 3-week pilot mobile phone/pedometer-based physical activity intervention. Forty-one sedentary women participated in the study. Measures Subjects were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. A qualitative description method was used to thematically analyze the interviews. Two investigators reviewed the transcripts independently and identified codes based on the main concerns in the interview questions. Results Three themes emerged from qualitative data shedding light on the perceived acceptability and usefulness of a mobile phone/pedometer-based intervention: (1) Monitor me: mobile phone/pedometer as self-monitoring tools, (2) Motivate me: cycle of feedback in goal setting and usefulness/uselessness of daily random messages, (3) Mobilize me: engaging and adapting physical activity to fit one's own lifestyle. Conclusion Mobile phone and pedometer-based physical activity programs might be helpful in keeping sedentary women engaged and motivated to increase their physical activity. A randomized controlled trial of this intervention is warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diverging trends of decreasing energy intake and increasing prevalence of obesity suggest that physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle may be one of the key determinants of the growing rates of overweight/obesity in Western populations information about the impact of physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyles on the prevalence of obesity among the general adult population in the European Union is sparse. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association of leisure-time sedentary and non-sedentary activities with body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and with the prevalence of obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2) in a sample of the 15 member states of the European Union. METHODS: Professional interviewers administered standardized in-home questionnaires to 15,239 men and women aged 15 years upwards, selected by a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling with quotas applied to ensure national and European representativeness. Energy expenditure during leisure time was calculated based on data on frequency of and amount of time participating in various physical activities, assigning metabolic equivalents (METS) to each activity. Sedentary lifestyle was assessed by means of self-reported hours spent sitting down during leisure time. Multiple linear regression models with BMI as the dependent variable, and logistic regression models with obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2) as the outcome, were fitted. RESULTS: Independent associations of leisure-time physical activity (inverse) and amount of time spent sitting down (direct) with BMI were found. The adjusted prevalence odds ratio (OR) for obesity was 0.52 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.64, P<0.001] for the upper quintile of physical activity (>30 METS) compared with the most physically inactive quintile (<1.75 METS). A positive independent association was also evident for the time spent sitting down, with an adjusted OR= 1.61(95{\%} CI: 1.33-1.95, P<0.001) for those who spent more than 35 h of their leisure time sitting down compared with those who spent less than 15 h. Conclusions: Obesity and higher body weight are strongly associated with a sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity in the adult population of the European Union. These results, however, need to be interpreted with caution due to the cross-sectional design. Nonetheless, they are consistent with the view that a reduction in energy expenditure during leisure time may be the main determinant of the current epidemic of obesity.},

Consumer wearable devices for activity tracking have shown promise in post-surgery recovery in cardiac patients, pulmonary rehabilitation, and activity counseling in diabetic patients, among others. Unfortunately, the data generated by wearable devices is seldom integrated into programmatic self-management chronic disease regimens. In addition, there is lack of evidence supporting sustained use or effects on health outcomes, as studies have primarily focused on establishing the feasibility of monitoring activity and the association of measured activity with short-term benefits.},

abstract = {The authors assessed individual, social, and school correlates of multiple chronic disease behavioral risk factors (physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and high body mass index) in a representative sample of Canadian youth aged 10-15 years (mean = 12.5 years) attending public schools. Cross-sectional data (n = 1,747) from cycle 4 (2000-2001) of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth were used. Ordinal regression models were constructed to investigate associations between selected covariates and multiple behavioral risk-factor levels (0/1, 2, 3, or 4/5 risk factors). Older age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.21, 3.13), caregiver smoking (OR = 1.49, 95{\%} CI: 1.09, 2.03), reporting that most/all of one's peers smoked (OR = 7.31, 95{\%} CI: 4.00, 13.35) or drank alcohol (OR = 3.77, 95{\%} CI: 2.18, 6.53), and living in a lone-parent family (OR = 1.94, 95{\%} CI: 1.31, 2.88) increased the likelihood of having multiple behavioral risk factors. Youth with high self-esteem (OR = 0.92, 95{\%} CI: 0.85, 0.99) and youth from families with postsecondary education (OR = 0.58, 95{\%} CI: 0.41, 0.82) were less likely to have a higher number of risk factors. Although several individual and social characteristics were associated with multiple behavioral risk factors, no school-related correlates emerged. These variables should be considered when planning prevention programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community trail development is an emerging strategy to increase physical activity (PA) among community residents. The purpose of this study was to assess awareness and use of trails and compare perceptions to objective data. METHODS: A telephone survey was administered to a stratified sample of adults (N = 1,112) in a southeastern county in the United States. Respondents' home addresses and the locations of trails were entered into a GIS database. A kappa statistic was used to measure agreement between awareness and presence of trails. Differences in reported trail use patterns by sex, race, education, and PA levels were evaluated. RESULTS: There was no agreement between the awareness and presence of trails (kappa = 0.07). Fifty-six percent of the respondents reported having trails; however, only 33{\%} reported using the trails. Of the trail users, 42{\%} reported being regularly active in moderate-to-vigorous PA (30+ min/day for 5+ days/week), and 51{\%} reported being less active (P < 0.003). Among walkers (> or =30 min/day for > or =5 days/week), 49{\%} of regular walkers and 35{\%} of irregular walkers (< walkers) reported using the trails (P < 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of existing trails in this community and levels of use were low. Marketing programs should promote awareness and use of trails among older adults and irregularly active adults.},

abstract = {Although it is no longer debatable that sedentary behaviors are an actual cause of many metabolic diseases, the physiology of physical inactivity has been poorly investigated for this purpose. Along with microgravity, the physiological adaptations to space flights require metabolic adaptations to physical inactivity and that is exceedingly well simulated during the ground-based microgravity bed-rest analogs. Bed-rest thus represents a unique model to investigate the mechanisms by which physical inactivity leads to the development of current societal chronic diseases. For decades, however, clinicians and physiologists working in space research have worked separately without taking full awareness of potential strong mutual questioning. This review summarizes the data collected over the last 60 years on metabolic adaptations to bed-rest in healthy subjects. Our aim is to provide evidence which support the hypothesis that physical inactivity per se is one of the primary causes in the development of metabolic inflexibility. This evidence will focus on four main tenants of metabolic inflexiblity: 1) insulin resistance, 2) impaired lipid trafficking and hyperlipidemia, 3) a shift in substrate use towards glucose, 4) a shift in muscle fiber type and ectopic fat storage. Altogether, this hypothesis places sedentary behaviors upstream on the list of factors involved in metabolic inflexibility which is considered to be a primary impairment in several metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin-resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In May 2013, the iTunes and Google Play stores contained 23,490 and 17,756 smartphone applications (apps) categorized as Health and Fitness, respectively. The quality of these apps, in terms of applying established health behavior change techniques, remains unclear. METHODS: The study sample was identified through systematic searches in iTunes and Google Play. Search terms were based on Boolean logic and included AND combinations for physical activity, healthy lifestyle, exercise, fitness, coach, assistant, motivation, and support. Sixty-four apps were downloaded, reviewed, and rated based on the taxonomy of behavior change techniques used in the interventions. Mean and ranges were calculated for the number of observed behavior change techniques. Using nonparametric tests, we compared the number of techniques observed in free and paid apps and in iTunes and Google Play. RESULTS: On average, the reviewed apps included 5 behavior change techniques (range 2-8). Techniques such as self-monitoring, providing feedback on performance, and goal-setting were used most frequently, whereas some techniques such as motivational interviewing, stress management, relapse prevention, self-talk, role models, and prompted barrier identification were not. No differences in the number of behavior change techniques between free and paid apps, or between the app stores were found. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that apps promoting physical activity applied an average of 5 out of 23 possible behavior change techniques. This number was not different for paid and free apps or between app stores. The most frequently used behavior change techniques in apps were similar to those most frequently used in other types of physical activity promotion interventions.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: There is evidence to suggest a beneficial effect of physical activity on several mental disorders. METHODS: The study aim was to assess the association between low physical activity during leisure time (or sedentary lifestyles) and the incidence of mental disorders in 10,381 participants, from a Spanish dynamic prospective cohort of university graduates followed up for 6 yr (the SUN study). The baseline assessment included a validated questionnaire on physical activity during leisure-time and sedentary activities. A subject was classified as an incident case of mental disorder if he or she reported a physician diagnosis of depression, anxiety or stress, and/or the use of antidepressant medication or tranquilizers in at least one of the follow-up questionnaires. RESULTS: The odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) of a mental disorder for successive levels of leisure-time physical activity were 1 (reference), 1.00 (0.81, 1.23), 0.99 (0.81, 1.21), 0.72 (0.58, 0.89), and 0.81 (0.65, 1.00) (P for trend: < 0.01). The OR for subjects who spent more than 42 h.wk(-1) watching television and/or using the computer was 1.31 (95{\%} CI = 1.01, 1.68) as compared with those spending less than 10.5 h.wk(-1). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a joint association of leisure-time physical activity and sedentary behavior on the incidence of mental disorders.},

abstract = {The model for human physical activity patterns was established not in gymnasia, athletic fields, or exercise physiology laboratories, but by natural selection acting over eons of evolutionary experience. This paper examines how evolution has determined the potential for contemporary human performance, and advances the experience of recently-studied hunter-gatherers as the best available (although admittedly imperfect) indicator of the physical activity patterns for which our genetically determined biology was originally selected. From the emergence of the genus Homo, over 2 million years ago (MYA), until the agricultural revolution of roughly 10000 years ago our ancestors were hunter-gatherers, so the adaptive pressures inherent in that environmental niche have exerted defining influence on human genetic makeup. The portion of our genome that determines basic anatomy and physiology has remained relatively unchanged over the past 40000 years. Thus, the complex interrelationship between energy intake, energy expenditure and specific physical activity requirements for current humans remains very similar to that originally selected for Stone Age men and women who lived by gathering and hunting. Research investigating optimal physical activity for human health and performance can be guided by understanding the evolution of physical activity patterns in our species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) declines as children and adolescents age. The purpose of this study was to examine how specific school factors relate to youth PA, TV viewing, and body mass index (BMI). METHODS: A sample of 12- to 18-year-old adolescents in 3 cities (N = 165, 53{\%} females, mean age 14.6 +/- 1.7 years, 44{\%} nonwhite) completed surveys assessing days of physical education (PE) class per week, school equipment accessibility, after-school supervised PA, and after-school field access. Regression analyses were conducted to examine relationships between these school factors and PA at school facilities open to the public (never active vs active), overall PA level (days per week physically active for 60 minutes), BMI z score, and TV watching (hours per week). RESULTS: Adjusting for demographics, days of PE per week and access to school fields after school were correlated with overall PA (beta= 0.286, p = .002, semipartial correlation .236 and beta= 0.801, p = .016, semipartial correlation .186, respectively). The association between after-school field access and overall PA was mediated by use of publicly accessible school facilities for PA. After-school supervised PA and school PA equipment were not associated with overall PA. In adjusted regression analyses including all school factors, days of PE remained correlated to overall PA independent of other school factors (beta= 0.264, p = .007, semipartial correlation = .136). There were no associations between school factors and BMI or TV watching. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these study findings, PE is a promising intervention to address improving overall adolescent PA within the school setting.},

abstract = {We re-examine the pace of rising obesity among Hispanic immigrants and the effects associated with longer duration in the US, or what is referred to as unhealthy assimilation, the convergence of immigrant health to a less healthy native-born standard. Consistent with previous research, we find that across all race-ethnic groups, immigrants tend to be less obese than native-born persons. Second, obesity is clearly on the rise, with obesity rates increasing for both immigrant and native-born populations between 1995 and 2005. However, our findings are that immigrant obesity rises more slowly than for native-born Hispanics in the same age cohort. The significance is that immigrants do not converge to obesity prevalence of the native-born as commonly assumed and, in fact, the differential is wider in 2005 than it was in 1995. The analysis, which is based on the National Health Interview Survey tracks the obesity rates of different cohort populations observed in repeated cross-sections (1995 and 2005), as both immigrants and the native-born grow older and additionally, as immigrants reside in the U.S. longer. More specifically, for immigrants, our study distinguishes the effects of length of U.S. residence (observed at a single point in time) and increasing duration of residence (observed over time). Of crucial importance, we contrast the changes over time for native and foreign-born residents passing through the same age range from 1995 to 2005. Misconclusions of previous research stem from 1) assuming that any change for immigrants equates to assimilation, without regard to native-born change, and 2) an unbalanced analysis that fails to track in parallel the growing obesity of both immigrant and native-born cohorts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a need to identify effective behavioural strategies for weight loss. Self-weighing may be one such strategy.

PURPOSE: To examine the effectiveness of self-weighing for weight loss.

METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that included self-weighing as an isolated intervention or as a component within an intervention. We used sub groups to analyse differences in frequency of weighing instruction (daily and weekly) and also whether including accountability affected weight loss.

RESULTS: Only one study examined self-weighing as a single strategy and there was no evidence it was effective (-0.5 kg 95 {\%} CI -1.3 to 0.3). Four trials added self-weighing/self-regulation techniques to multi-component programmes and resulted in a significant difference of -1.7 kg (95 {\%} CI -2.6 to -0.8). Fifteen trials comparing multi-component interventions including self-weighing compared with no intervention or minimal control resulted in a significant mean difference of -3.4 kg (95 {\%} CI -4.2 to -2.6). There was no significant difference in the interventions with weekly or daily weighing. In trials which included accountability there was significantly greater weight loss (p = 0.03).

CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of evidence of whether advising self-weighing without other intervention components is effective. Adding self-weighing to a behavioural weight loss programme may improve weight loss. Behavioural weight loss programmes that include self-weighing are more effective than minimal interventions. Accountability may improve the effectiveness of interventions that include self-weighing.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This 3-year field experiment engaged 60 nurses and 282 patients in the design and evaluation of an innovative home-care nursing model, referred to as technology-enhanced practice (TEP).

METHODS: Nurses using TEP augmented the usual care with a web-based resource (HeartCareII) that provided patients with self-management information, self-monitoring tools, and messaging services.

RESULTS: Patients exposed to TEP demonstrated better quality of life and self-management of chronic heart disease during the first 4 weeks, and were no more likely than patients in usual care to make unplanned visits to a clinician or hospital. Both groups demonstrated the same long-term symptom management and achievements in health status.

CONCLUSION: This project provides new evidence that the purposeful creation of patient-tailored web resources within a hospital portal is possible; that nurses have difficulty with modifying their practice routines, even with a highly-tailored web resource; and that the benefits of this intervention are more discernable in the early postdischarge stages of care.},

However, research has shown that {\{}approx{\}}20{\%} of overweight individuals are successful at long-term weight loss when defined as losing at least 10{\%} of initial body weight and maintaining the loss for at least 1 y. The National Weight Control Registry provides information about the strategies used by successful weight loss maintainers to achieve and maintain long-term weight loss. National Weight Control Registry members have lost an average of 33 kg and maintained the loss for more than 5 y. To maintain their weight loss, members report engaging in high levels of physical activity ({\{}approx{\}}1 h/d), eating a low-calorie, low-fat diet, eating breakfast regularly, self-monitoring weight, and maintaining a consistent eating pattern across weekdays and weekends. Moreover, weight loss maintenance may get easier over time; after individuals have successfully maintained their weight loss for 2-5 y, the chance of longer-term success greatly increases. Continued adherence to diet and exercise strategies, low levels of depression and disinhibition, and medical triggers for weight loss are also associated with long-term success. National Weight Control Registry members provide evidence that long-term weight loss maintenance is possible and help identify the specific approaches associated with long-term success.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychosocial factors have been related to physical activity (PA) and are used to evaluate mediation in PA interventions.

METHODS: Brief theory-based psychosocial scales were compiled from existing measures and evaluated. Study 1 assessed factor structure and construct validity with self-reported PA and accelerometry in overweight/obese men (N = 441) and women (N = 401). Study 2 assessed 2-week reliability and internal consistency in 49 college students.

RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit in men and women (CFI = .90; RMSEA = .05). Construct validity was supported for change strategies (r = .29-.46), self-efficacy (r = .19-.22) and enjoyment (r = .21-.33) in men and women, and for cons in women (r = -.19 to -.20). PA pros (r = -.02 to .11) and social support (r = -.01 to .12) were not supported for construct validity. Test-retest reliability ICCs ranged from .49-.81. Internal consistency alphas ranged from .55-.90. Reliability was supported for most scales with further testing needed for cons (alphas = .55-.63) and enjoyment (ICC = .49).

CONCLUSIONS: Many of the brief scales demonstrated adequate reliability and validity, while some need further development. The use of these scales could advance research and practice in the promotion of PA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increase the risk of chronic illness and death. The newest generation of "wearable" activity trackers offers potential as a multifaceted intervention to help people become more active.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the usability and usefulness of wearable activity trackers for older adults living with chronic illness.

METHODS: We recruited a purposive sample of 32 participants over the age of 50, who had been previously diagnosed with a chronic illness, including vascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Participants were between 52 and 84 years of age (mean 64); among the study participants, 23 (72{\%}) were women and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m(2). Participants tested 5 trackers, including a simple pedometer (Sportline or Mio) followed by 4 wearable activity trackers (Fitbit Zip, Misfit Shine, Jawbone Up 24, and Withings Pulse) in random order. Selected devices represented the range of wearable products and features available on the Canadian market in 2014. Participants wore each device for at least 3 days and evaluated it using a questionnaire developed from the Technology Acceptance Model. We used focus groups to explore participant experiences and a thematic analysis approach to data collection and analysis.

RESULTS: Our study resulted in 4 themes: (1) adoption within a comfort zone; (2) self-awareness and goal setting; (3) purposes of data tracking; and (4) future of wearable activity trackers as health care devices. Prior to enrolling, few participants were aware of wearable activity trackers. Most also had been asked by a physician to exercise more and cited this as a motivation for testing the devices. None of the participants planned to purchase the simple pedometer after the study, citing poor accuracy and data loss, whereas 73{\%} (N=32) planned to purchase a wearable activity tracker. Preferences varied but 50{\%} felt they would buy a Fitbit and 42{\%} felt they would buy a Misfit, Jawbone, or Withings. The simple pedometer had a mean acceptance score of 56/95 compared with 63 for the Withings, 65 for the Misfit and Jawbone, and 68 for the Fitbit. To improve usability, older users may benefit from devices that have better compatibility with personal computers or less-expensive Android mobile phones and tablets, and have comprehensive paper-based user manuals and apps that interpret user data.

CONCLUSIONS: For older adults living with chronic illness, wearable activity trackers are perceived as useful and acceptable. New users may need support to both set up the device and learn how to interpret their data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: To examine the relationship of self-reported television (TV) viewing time with accelerometer-derived total sedentary time, and to determine whether it differs by subgroup. METHODS:: Using data for adults (≥ 20 years) from the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 nationally-representative US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES; n=5738), linear regression models examined the associations of categories of self-reported TV viewing time (<1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+ hrs/day) with accelerometer-derived sedentary time (<100 counts/min; hrs/day). Spearman's rho assessed the correlation between participants' rankings on the two measures. Analyses were stratified by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and, in the 2003-2004 NHANES cycle, by work status among working-aged adults (20-65years, n=2069). RESULTS:: TV viewing time was significantly associated with sedentary time, with positive associations for all gender, age, race/ethnicity groups, and for those not working or working part-time, but not for those in full-time work. However, correlations between rankings of the measures were only 'fair' overall (rho=0.22) and were similar for all gender and racial/ethnic groups, and for those of mid and older-age, but not for those of younger age (20-39 yrs, rho=0.05). In the working-aged subgroup, there was also a 'fair' correlation between the measures for those not working (rho=0.22), but no significant correlation for those in part-time (rho=0.14) or full-time work (rho=0.03). CONCLUSIONS:: Associations of TV viewing time with accelerometer-derived total sedentary time were statistically significant, but correlations were of only fair magnitude and the strength of the relationship was not consistent across all population subgroups. These findings suggest TV viewing time has an influence on overall sedentary time at a population level; however, measurement of sedentary time in other domains is also important.},

The review focused on the wider determinants of health, examining community- and society-level interventions. Four trials and 16 studies of young people's views were included. Evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions was limited, with some suggestions of improvements in knowledge and possible differences according to gender. Young women in particular identified barriers to physical activity associated with certain ways of providing physical education in schools. Young people in general identified a need for increased choice and facilities within the community and emphasized physical activity's social side. Some of the barriers and facilitators identified by young people had been addressed by 'soundly evaluated' effective interventions but significant gaps were identified where no evaluated interventions appear to have been published (e.g. initiatives explicitly addressing gender issues or the combination of sport and other leisure activities), or where there were no soundly evaluated interventions. Rigorous evaluation is required particularly to assess initiatives that address the limited practical and material resources that young people identify as barriers to physical activity.},

abstract = {Adverse and suboptimal health behaviors and habits are responsible for approximately 40 {\%} of preventable deaths, in addition to their unfavorable effects on quality of life and economics. Our current understanding of human behavior is largely based on static "snapshots" of human behavior, rather than ongoing, dynamic feedback loops of behavior in response to ever-changing biological, social, personal, and environmental states. This paper first discusses how new technologies (i.e., mobile sensors, smartphones, ubiquitous computing, and cloud-enabled processing/computing) and emerging systems modeling techniques enable the development of new, dynamic, and empirical models of human behavior that could facilitate just-in-time adaptive, scalable interventions. The paper then describes concrete steps to the creation of robust dynamic mathematical models of behavior including: (1) establishing "gold standard" measures, (2) the creation of a behavioral ontology for shared language and understanding tools that both enable dynamic theorizing across disciplines, (3) the development of data sharing resources, and (4) facilitating improved sharing of mathematical models and tools to support rapid aggregation of the models. We conclude with the discussion of what might be incorporated into a "knowledge commons," which could help to bring together these disparate activities into a unified system and structure for organizing knowledge about behavior.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Self-management of risk behaviors is a cornerstone of future population health interventions. Using mobile phones for routine self-monitoring and feedback is a cost-efficient strategy for self-management and ecological momentary interventions (EMI). However, mobile health applications need to be designed to be highly attractive and acceptable to a broad range of user groups. To inform the design of an adaptable mobile health application we aimed to identify the dimensions and range of user preferences for application features by different user groups.

METHODS: Five focus group interviews were conducted: two (n=9; n=20) with people living with HIV (PLH) and three with young mothers (n=6; n=8; n=10). Thematic analyses were conducted on the focus group sessions' notes and transcripts.

RESULTS: Both groups considered customization of reminders and prompts as necessary, and goal setting, motivational messaging, problem solving, and feedback as attractive. For PLH, automated and location-based reminders for medication adherence and sharing data with healthcare providers were both acceptable and attractive features. Privacy protection and invasiveness were the primary concerns, particularly around location tracking, illegal drug use, and sexual partner information. Concerns were ameliorated by use scenario or purpose, monetary incentives, and password protection. Privacy was not a major concern to mothers who considered passwords burdensome. Mothers' preferences focused on customization that supports mood, exercise and eating patterns, and especially using the mobile phone camera to photograph food to increase self-accountability.

CONCLUSIONS: Individualization emerged as the key feature and design principle to reduce user burden and increase attractiveness and acceptability. Mobile phone EMI uniquely enables individualization, context-aware and real-time feedback, and tailored intervention delivery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: CONSORT guidelines call for precise reporting of behavior change interventions: we need rigorous methods of characterizing active content of interventions with precision and specificity.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to develop an extensive, consensually agreed hierarchically structured taxonomy of techniques [behavior change techniques (BCTs)] used in behavior change interventions.

METHODS: In a Delphi-type exercise, 14 experts rated labels and definitions of 124 BCTs from six published classification systems. Another 18 experts grouped BCTs according to similarity of active ingredients in an open-sort task. Inter-rater agreement amongst six researchers coding 85 intervention descriptions by BCTs was assessed.

RESULTS: This resulted in 93 BCTs clustered into 16 groups. Of the 26 BCTs occurring at least five times, 23 had adjusted kappas of 0.60 or above.

CONCLUSIONS: "BCT taxonomy v1," an extensive taxonomy of 93 consensually agreed, distinct BCTs, offers a step change as a method for specifying interventions, but we anticipate further development and evaluation based on international, interdisciplinary consensus.},

abstract = {Although there would appear to be considerable potential for improving the health, productivity and quality of life of the Australian workforce through workplace physical activity (PA) promotion programs, the scientific evidence that such programs are effective is limited. This review appraises the quality of intervention studies conducted since 1997. Most studies included volunteer participants, who were either sufficiently motivated to change their behaviour or already active. Interventions that focused on corporate-fitness type programs and the provision of generic health education programs were not effective in terms of adequate participation rates and sustained behaviour change. The more successful individually-based programs were those which tailored materials to individual needs. The greatest potential for influencing the overall workforce appeared to be programs that included less 'organised' approaches and promoted incidental PA within and around the workplace. Future programs should; incorporate contemporary theories of behaviour and organisational change; emphasise linkages between the workplace and external settings; expand the profile of programs to address workplace culture; and encourage management support for behavioural adjustments to the organisation. There is a need for greater understanding and evaluation of desirable employer-related outcomes, such as reduced absenteeism, job stress and turnover and improved productivity and job satisfaction, coupled with the exploration of how these factors may relate to PA promotion and adoption. Finally, more in-depth evaluation strategies and complete descriptions of intervention programs are required, in order to identify the most effective strategies.},

Our data indicate similar L2-4 BMD in both groups due to equal weight load of the upper part of the body on the spinal column in both study groups, but higher femur BMD in the nurse group (0.6-0.8 SD, at various hip measurement sites) than in the clerk group. The age-adjusted hip BMD was correlated with serum osteocalcin levels, and was related to the duration of standing at work, indicating a cause and effect relationship. We conclude that prolonged working in a sitting position may induce a low hip BMD, and thereby increase the risk for osteoporotic hip fracture.},

abstract = {Data on health and wellness from around the world reveal a pattern of less than optimal outcomes for the young and old alike. These results are not limited to the developing world. In fact, a recent report showed that Americans die sooner and experience higher rates of disease and injury than people in other high-income countries [1]. Although the precise causes of these disparities are not fully elucidated, chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease, are increasing in the Western world. Similarly, in the low- and middle-income countries, chronic disease is increasingly being cited as an emerging problem and a major component of disease burden [2]. It is widely suspected that the increased prevalence of unhealthy behaviors plays a significant role in overall health and in chronic disease. Indeed, it has been estimated that approximately 40{\%} of all premature deaths are due to behavioral patterns that are potentially modifiable [3]. Further, in patients suffering from chronic disease, self-management of health behaviors (e.g., eating well, exercising as indicated, and taking medication as directed) has been shown to have a significant effect on symptom reduction and quality of life, as well as reducing costs in the health-care system [4]. Finally, enhancing health behavior to prevent disease has been consistently shown to decrease adverse health events over time. Thus, the dangerous effects of inactivity, poor diet, smoking, drug and alcohol use, lack of sleep, and chronically stressful environments are now widely appreciated to be associated with not only the quality of life but also with mortality and health-care and disability costs.},

abstract = {Recent data suggest that that the United States is failing to make significant progress toward the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities. One missing element from the US strategy for achieving this goal is a focus on gaps in child development and achievement. Academic achievement and education seem to be critical determinants of health across the life span and disparities in one contribute to disparities in the other. Despite these linkages, national policy treats child education and health as separate. Landmark education legislation, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, is due for Congressional reauthorization. It seeks to eliminate gaps in academic child achievement by 2014. It does so by introducing accountability for states, school districts, and schools. In this special article, we review health disparities and contributors to child achievement gaps. We review changes in achievement gaps over time and potential contributors to the limited success of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, including its unfunded mandates and unfounded assumptions. We conclude with key reforms, which include addressing gaps in child school readiness through adequate investment in child health and early education and reductions in child poverty; closing the gap in child achievement by ensuring equity in school accountability standards; and, importantly, ensuring equity in school funding so that resources are allocated on the basis of the needs of the students. This will ensure that schools, particularly those serving large numbers of poor and minority children, have the resources necessary to promote optimal learning.},

METHODS: Adults employed within Australia in primarily sedentary occupations and voluntarily enrolled in a workplace programme, the Global Corporate Challenge®, aimed at increasing physical activity were recruited. Data included demographic, behavioural, anthropometric and biomedical measurements. Measures were compared between baseline and four-months. RESULTS: 762 participants were recruited in April/May 2008 with 79{\%} returning. Improvements between baseline and four-months amongst programme participants were observed for physical activity (an increase of 6.5{\%} in the proportion meeting guidelines, OR(95{\%}CI): 1.7(1.1, 2.5)), fruit intake (4{\%}, OR: 1.7(1.0, 3.0)), vegetable intake (2{\%}, OR: 1.3(1.0, 1.8)), sitting time (-0.6(-0.9, -0.3) hours/day), blood pressure (systolic: -1.8(-3.1, -.05) mmHg; diastolic: -1.8(-2.4, -1.3) mmHg) and waist circumference (-1.6(-2.4, -0.7) cm). In contrast, an increase was found for fasting total cholesterol (0.3(0.1, 0.4) mmol/L) and triglycerides (0.1(0.0, 0.1) mmol/L). CONCLUSION: Completion of this four-month, pedometer-based, physical activity, workplace programme was associated with improvements in behavioural and anthropometric risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Long-term evaluation is required to evaluate the potential of such programmes to prevent the onset of chronic disease.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a school-based intervention (Program X) incorporating pedometers and e-mail support on physical activity, sedentary behavior, and healthy eating in adolescents. METHODS: A randomized control trial was used to evaluate the impact of the Program X intervention. Six schools (N = 124 participants; mean age 14.1 +/- .8 years) were randomized to intervention or control conditions for the 6-month study period. Objectively recorded physical activity (mean steps/day), self-reported sedentary behavior, and dietary habits were measured at baseline and at 6-month follow-up and intervention effects were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group increased their step counts by 956 +/- 4107 steps/day (boys) and 999 +/- 1999 (girls). Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant group-by-time interactions for boys (F = 7.4, p = .01, d = .80) and girls (F = 29.6, p <.001, d = 1.27) for mean steps/day. The intervention significantly decreased the number of energy-dense/low-nutrient snacks consumed by boys (chi(2) = 4.0, p = .043) and increased the number of fruit serves among girls (chi(2) = 4.8, p = .028). The intervention did not have a statistically significant effect on sedentary behavior. CONCLUSION: A school-based intervention incorporating physical activity monitoring using pedometers and e-mail support was successful in promoting physical activity and selected healthy eating behaviors in adolescent boys and girls.},

@article{Tudor-Locke2011c,
abstract = {Physical activity guidelines from around the world are typically expressed in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity parameters. Objective monitoring using pedometers and accelerometers offers a new opportunity to measure and communicate physical activity in terms of steps/day. Various step-based versions or translations of physical activity guidelines are emerging, reflecting public interest in such guidance. However, there appears to be a wide discrepancy in the exact values that are being communicated. It makes sense that step-based recommendations should be harmonious with existing evidence-based public health guidelines that recognize that "some physical activity is better than none" while maintaining a focus on time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Thus, the purpose of this review was to update our existing knowledge of "How many steps/day are enough?", and to inform step-based recommendations consistent with current physical activity guidelines. Normative data indicate that healthy adults typically take between 4,000 and 18,000 steps/day, and that 10,000 steps/day is reasonable for this population, although there are notable "low active populations." Interventions demonstrate incremental increases on the order of 2,000-2,500 steps/day. The results of seven different controlled studies demonstrate that there is a strong relationship between cadence and intensity. Further, despite some inter-individual variation, 100 steps/minute represents a reasonable floor value indicative of moderate intensity walking. Multiplying this cadence by 30 minutes (i.e., typical of a daily recommendation) produces a minimum of 3,000 steps that is best used as a heuristic (i.e., guiding) value, but these steps must be taken over and above habitual activity levels to be a true expression of free-living steps/day that also includes recommendations for minimal amounts of time in MVPA. Computed steps/day translations of time in MVPA that also include estimates of habitual activity levels equate to 7,100 to 11,000 steps/day. A direct estimate of minimal amounts of MVPA accumulated in the course of objectively monitored free-living behaviour is 7,000-8,000 steps/day. A scale that spans a wide range of incremental increases in steps/day and is congruent with public health recognition that "some physical activity is better than none," yet still incorporates step-based translations of recommended amounts of time in MVPA may be useful in research and practice. The full range of users (researchers to practitioners to the general public) of objective monitoring instruments that provide step-based outputs require good reference data and evidence-based recommendations to be able to design effective health messages congruent with public health physical activity guidelines, guide behaviour change, and ultimately measure, track, and interpret steps/day.},

abstract = {The aim of this systematic review was to describe the prospective relationship between childhood sedentary behaviour and health indicators. We identified prospective studies from searches in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycInfo and Cochrane, from January 1989 through April 2010. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility, rated the methodological quality of the studies, and extracted data. We identified 31 papers, examining 27 different cohorts. The quality score of the studies ranged from 38 to 88{\%}. Nine studies were scored as high quality. According to the best evidence synthesis we found insufficient evidence for a longitudinal positive relationship between 'sedentary time'- mainly TV viewing - and body mass index (BMI) and more specific indicators of fat mass. One high quality and two low quality studies found a significant inverse relationship between sedentary time - mainly TV viewing - and aerobic fitness, leading to moderate evidence for this inverse relationship. There was insufficient evidence for a longitudinal relationship between sedentary time and blood pressure, blood lipids or bone mass. Our systematic review suggests that there is moderate evidence for a longitudinal inverse relationship between screen time and aerobic fitness during childhood. Thus there is evidence to limit screen time in young people in order to prevent low levels of fitness. The possible detrimental health effects of prolonged or excessive sitting on other health indicators needs further study.},

In this study, the authors employed two strategies that addressed these two sources of bias. First, to mitigate overadjustment of mediators, they adjusted for baseline characteristics observed just prior to the measurement of neighborhood context, using a combined propensity score and regression strategy. Second, to mitigate underadjustment of unmeasured confounders, they employed a fixed-effects modeling strategy to account for unobserved non-time-varying heterogeneity. Analyses were based on a nationally representative sample of the nonimmigrant US population from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1980-1997) in which respondent-rated health was regressed on neighborhood poverty. The samples consisted of approximately 6,000 respondents for the propensity score/regression models and 45,000 person-years for the fixed-effects models. Both modeling strategies yielded significant estimates of neighborhood poverty and supported a causal link between neighborhood context and health.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in DNA sequencing promise to enable new diagnostics and individualized therapies. Achieving personalized medicine, however, will require extensive research on highly reidentifiable, integrated datasets of genomic and health information. To assist with this, participants in the Personal Genome Project choose to forgo privacy via our institutional review board- approved "open consent" process. The contribution of public data and samples facilitates both scientific discovery and standardization of methods. We present our findings after enrollment of more than 1,800 participants, including whole-genome sequencing of 10 pilot participant genomes (the PGP-10). We introduce the Genome-Environment-Trait Evidence (GET-Evidence) system. This tool automatically processes genomes and prioritizes both published and novel variants for interpretation. In the process of reviewing the presumed healthy PGP-10 genomes, we find numerous literature references implying serious disease. Although it is sometimes impossible to rule out a late-onset effect, stringent evidence requirements can address the high rate of incidental findings. To that end we develop a peer production system for recording and organizing variant evaluations according to standard evidence guidelines, creating a public forum for reaching consensus on interpretation of clinically relevant variants. Genome analysis becomes a two-step process: using a prioritized list to record variant evaluations, then automatically sorting reviewed variants using these annotations. Genome data, health and trait information, participant samples, and variant interpretations are all shared in the public domain-we invite others to review our results using our participant samples and contribute to our interpretations. We offer our public resource and methods to further personalized medical research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have found physical activity to be associated with lower mortality, the dose-response relationship remains unclear. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we quantify the dose-response relationship of non-vigorous physical activity and all-cause mortality. METHODS: We aimed to include all cohort studies in adult populations with a sample size of more than 10 000 participants that estimated the effect of different levels of light or moderate physical activity on all-cause mortality. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane (DARE), Web of Science and Global Health (June 2009). We used dose-response meta-regression models to estimate the relation between non-vigorous physical activity and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 22 studies that met our inclusion criteria, containing 977 925 (334 738 men and 643 187 women) people. There was considerable variation between the studies in their categorization of physical activity and adjustment for potential confounders. We found that 2.5 h/week (equivalent to 30 min daily of moderate intensity activity on 5 days a week) compared with no activity was associated with a reduction in mortality risk of 19{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 15-24], while 7 h/week of moderate activity compared with no activity reduced the mortality risk by 24{\%} (95{\%} CI 19-29). We found a smaller effect in studies that looked at walking alone. CONCLUSION: Being physically active reduces the risk of all-cause mortality. The largest benefit was found from moving from no activity to low levels of activity, but even at high levels of activity benefits accrue from additional activity.},

@article{Lewis2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing global health concern that may lead to cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and cancer. Several systematic reviews have shown that technology is successful in combating obesity through increased physical activity, but there is no known review on interventions that use an electronic activity monitor system (EAMS). EAMSs are defined as a wearable device that objectively measures lifestyle physical activity and can provide feedback, beyond the display of basic activity count information, via the monitor display or through a partnering application to elicit continual self-monitoring of activity behavior. These devices improve upon standard pedometers because they have the ability to provide visual feedback on activity progression, verbal encouragement, and social comparison. This systematic review aimed to synthesize the efficacy and feasibility results of EAMSs within published physical activity interventions.

METHODS: Electronic databases and journal references were searched for relevant articles. Data sources included CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Medline Ovid, PsycINFO, and clinicaltrials.gov. Out of the 1,574 retrieved, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria. These articles were reviewed for quality and content based on a risk of bias tool and intervention components.

RESULTS: Most articles were determined to be of medium quality while two were of low quality, and one of high quality. Significant pre-post improvements in the EAMS group were found in five of nine studies for physical activity and in four of five studies for weight. One found a significant increase in physical activity and two studies found significant weight loss in the intervention group compared with the comparator group. The EAMS interventions appear to be feasible with most studies reporting continual wear of the device during waking hours and a higher retention rate of participants in the EAMS groups.

CONCLUSION: These studies provide preliminary evidence suggesting that EAMS can increase physical activity and decrease weight significantly, but their efficacy compared to other interventions has not yet been demonstrated. More high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the overall effect of EAMS, examine which EAMS features are most effective, and determine which populations are most receptive to an EAMS.},

We also describe challenges facing our approach, including a lack of common language and training on the part of patients and resistance on the part of researchers to questions that are not researcher generated. Faced with the reality that PCORI will not be able to fund all research questions posed to it, there will also be difficult decisions to make when selecting those that have the highest priority for funding.},

abstract = {There is an inverse relationship between physical activity and weight gain. However, additional research is needed to quantify the amount of physical activity required to prevent weight gain in different populations, improve the way we convey physical activity recommendations to the public, and help the individuals increase their physical activity. Although physical activity does not appear to contribute significantly to weight loss, it is critical for maintenance of weight loss. Available data are consistent in that 60-90 min/day of moderate-intensity physical activity is required to maintain a significant weight loss. Although there is agreement about the need for high levels of physical activity to maintain weight loss, there is a need for more research to understand why physical activity is critical for weight loss maintenance. Finally, additional research is needed to determine whether there is an optimal level of physical activity below which it is difficult for most people to achieve a balance between energy intake and expenditure at a healthy body weight. The increasing prevalence of obesity may reflect the fact that the majority of the population has fallen below such a level of physical activity.},

Although the association between SB (e.g., watching TV/using the computer) and physical health has been well documented, increasing research has focused on the possible link between SB and mental health (e.g., depression). PURPOSE: This review aims to investigate the effect of SB on the risk of depression in adults. METHOD: A systematic search for original research articles investigating associations between SB and depression in adults was performed using the several electronic data bases. RESULTS: A total of seven observational and four intervention studies were included in this review. All observational studies found positive associations between SB and risk of depression, while intervention studies showed contradictory results. CONCLUSION: Evidence for the relationship between SB and risk of depression in adults is limited by methodological weaknesses. However, on balance, this review suggests that SB is associated with an increased risk of depression. Further studies are needed assessing different types of SB and depression; the interrelationship between physical activity, SB, and depression; causal links between SB and depression; and intervention strategies aimed at reducing SB and their effects on risk of depression.},

Design Cross-sectional analysis of data from the European Youth Heart Study (EYHS). Setting Schools in Denmark, Estonia, Portugal and Norway. Participants Respondents were invited using a twostage cluster sampling procedure. Analyses include 2107 children (9-10 years old) and adolescents (14-15 years old). Assessment of independent variables Seven behavioural and 15 social variables assessed by parental and computerised child questionnaires. Main outcome measure Sedentary activity as assessed by accelerometry (10 min blocks at <200 counts/min). Analyses were stratified by country, and interactions with grade and sex were investigated. Results Adolescents were more sedentary than children (335.4 (90.4 min/day) vs 217.2 (75.6 min/day), p<0.001). Patterns of associations differed across countries. High computer use and no television viewing before school in Norway, and being sedentary during school breaks in Estonia were positively associated with sedentary time. No behavioural variables were associated with sedentary time in the Danish and Portuguese models. Socioeconomic position was positively associated with sedentary time in Portugal and Estonia, father's body mass index negatively in the Estonian model. Norwegian participants with a game console at home and Portuguese participants with a television in their bedroom were more sedentary. Conclusions A single strategy aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour is unlikely to be effective across Europe as the target populations and behaviours of focus differ between countries. Targeting high socioeconomic groups in Portugal and Estonia or focusing on reducing computer use in Norway might be effective intervention strategies to reduce overall sedentary time.},

Eight focus groups were conducted with 38 students in four schools to examine student perceptions of who or what in their school made it easy or difficult for students to be physically active. Qualitative data were used to identify potential intervention targets according to the analytic framework. Frequency analysis revealed that most identified physical activity barriers/facilitators were associated with organization (59.4{\%}) targets. Five different intervention strategies were identified, with organizational modification being most popular. Applying the analytic framework to formative data enabled us to identify potential targets, strategies, and activities for an ecologically based physical-activity-promotion program relevant to the priority population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electronic activity monitors (such as those manufactured by Fitbit, Jawbone, and Nike) improve on standard pedometers by providing automated feedback and interactive behavior change tools via mobile device or personal computer. These monitors are commercially popular and show promise for use in public health interventions. However, little is known about the content of their feedback applications and how individual monitors may differ from one another.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the behavior change techniques implemented in commercially available electronic activity monitors.

METHODS: Electronic activity monitors (N=13) were systematically identified and tested by 3 trained coders for at least 1 week each. All monitors measured lifestyle physical activity and provided feedback via an app (computer or mobile). Coding was based on a hierarchical list of 93 behavior change techniques. Further coding of potentially effective techniques and adherence to theory-based recommendations were based on findings from meta-analyses and meta-regressions in the research literature.

RESULTS: All monitors provided tools for self-monitoring, feedback, and environmental change by definition. The next most prevalent techniques (13 out of 13 monitors) were goal-setting and emphasizing discrepancy between current and goal behavior. Review of behavioral goals, social support, social comparison, prompts/cues, rewards, and a focus on past success were found in more than half of the systems. The monitors included a range of 5-10 of 14 total techniques identified from the research literature as potentially effective. Most of the monitors included goal-setting, self-monitoring, and feedback content that closely matched recommendations from social cognitive theory.

CONCLUSIONS: Electronic activity monitors contain a wide range of behavior change techniques typically used in clinical behavioral interventions. Thus, the monitors may represent a medium by which these interventions could be translated for widespread use. This technology has broad applications for use in clinical, public health, and rehabilitation settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Hvidoere Study Group on Childhood Diabetes has demonstrated persistent differences in metabolic outcomes between pediatric diabetes centers. These differences cannot be accounted for by differences in demographic, medical, or treatment variables. Therefore, we sought to explore whether differences in physical activity or sedentary behavior could explain the variation in metabolic outcomes between centers. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional international study in 21 centers, with demographic and clinical data obtained by questionnaire from participants. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were assayed in one central laboratory. All individuals with diabetes aged 11-18 yr (49.4{\%} female), with duration of diabetes of at least 1 yr, were invited to participate. Individuals completed a self-reported measure of quality of life (Diabetes Quality of Life - Short Form DQOL-SF), with well-being and leisure time activity assessed using measures developed by Health Behaviour in School Children WHO Project. RESULTS: Older participants (p < 0.001) and females (p < 0.001) reported less physical activity. Physical activity was associated with positive health perception (p < 0.001) but not with glycemic control, body mass index, frequency of hypoglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. The more time spent on the computer (r = 0.06; p < 0.05) and less time spent doing school homework (r = -0.09; p < 0.001) were associated with higher HbA1c. Between centers, there were significant differences in reported physical activity (p < 0.001) and sedentary behavior (p < 0.001), but these differences did not account for center differences in metabolic control. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity is strongly associated with psychological well-being but has weak associations with metabolic control. Leisure time activity is associated with individual differences in HbA1c but not with intercenter differences.},

The focus is on instruments that have been used in free-living, population-based research in adults. Data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey are utilized to compare the descriptive epidemiology of sedentary time that arises from the use of different sedentary time measures. A key recommendation from this review is that, wherever possible, population-based monitoring of sedentary time should incorporate both self-reported measures (to capture important domain- and behavior-specific sedentary time information) and device-based measures (to measure both total sedentary time and patterns of sedentary time accumulation).},

abstract = {Control theory and other frameworks for understanding self-regulation suggest that monitoring goal progress is a crucial process that intervenes between setting and attaining a goal, and helps to ensure that goals are translated into action. However, the impact of progress monitoring interventions on rates of behavioral performance and goal attainment has yet to be quantified. A systematic literature search identified 138 studies (N = 19,951) that randomly allocated participants to an intervention designed to promote monitoring of goal progress versus a control condition. All studies reported the effects of the treatment on (a) the frequency of progress monitoring and (b) subsequent goal attainment. A random effects model revealed that, on average, interventions were successful at increasing the frequency of monitoring goal progress (d+ = 1.98, 95{\%} CI [1.71, 2.24]) and promoted goal attainment (d+ = 0.40, 95{\%} CI [0.32, 0.48]). Furthermore, changes in the frequency of progress monitoring mediated the effect of the interventions on goal attainment. Moderation tests revealed that progress monitoring had larger effects on goal attainment when the outcomes were reported or made public, and when the information was physically recorded. Taken together, the findings suggest that monitoring goal progress is an effective self-regulation strategy, and that interventions that increase the frequency of progress monitoring are likely to promote behavior change. },

The effect of reducing television watching and other sedentary behaviors as a component of a comprehensive obesity treatment program has not been thoroughly tested. OBJECTIVE: To compare the influence of targeting decreases in sedentary behavior vs. increases in physical activity in the comprehensive treatment of obesity in 8- to 12-year-old children. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled outcome study. SETTING: Childhood obesity research clinic. DESIGN: Ninety families with obese 8- to 12-year-old children were randomly assigned to groups that were provided a comprehensive family-based behavioral weight control program that included dietary, and behavior change information but differed in whether sedentary or physically active behaviors were targeted and the degree of behavior change required. RESULTS: Results during 2 years showed that targeting either decreased sedentary behaviors or increased physical activity was associated with significant decreases in percent overweight and body fat and improved aerobic fitness. Self-reported activity minutes increased and targeted sedentary time decreased during treatment. Children substituted nontargeted sedentary behaviors for some of their targeted sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSION: These results support reducing sedentary behaviors as an adjunct in the treatment of pediatric obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efforts to achieve population-wide increases in walking and similar moderate-intensity physical activities potentially can be enhanced through relevant applications of state-of-the-art interactive communication technologies. Yet few systematic efforts to evaluate the efficacy of hand-held computers and similar devices for enhancing physical activity levels have occurred. The purpose of this first-generation study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant [PDA]) for increasing moderate intensity or more vigorous (MOD+) physical activity levels over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults relative to a standard information control arm. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled 8-week experiment. Data were collected in 2005 and analyzed in 2006-2007. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Community-based study of 37 healthy, initially underactive adults aged 50 years and older who were randomized and completed the 8-week study (intervention=19, control=18). INTERVENTION: Participants received an instructional session and a PDA programmed to monitor their physical activity levels twice per day and provide daily and weekly individualized feedback, goal setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate written physical activity educational materials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Physical activity was assessed via the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater 8-week mean estimated caloric expenditure levels and minutes per week in MOD+ activity (p<0.04). Satisfaction with the PDA was reasonably high in this largely PDA-naive sample. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this first-generation study indicate that hand-held computers may be effective tools for increasing initial physical activity levels among underactive adults.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and metabolic syndrome in a representative sample of U.S. adults. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A total of 1626 men and women > or =20 years old from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2000 who attended the morning examination were evaluated. The metabolic syndrome was defined by using the definition from the National Cholesterol Education Program. RESULTS: In unadjusted analysis, participants who did not engage in any moderate or vigorous physical activity during leisure time had almost twice the odds of having metabolic syndrome [odds ratio (OR), 1.90; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.22 to 2.97] as those who reportedly engaged in > or =150 min/wk of such activity. Adjustment for age, sex, race or ethnicity, educational status, smoking status, and alcohol use attenuated the OR (OR, 1.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 2.45). Compared with participants who watched television or videos or used a computer <1 h/d outside of work, the adjusted ORs for having metabolic syndrome were 1.41 (95{\%} CI 0.80 to 2.51) for 1 h/d, 1.37 (95{\%} CI 0.85 to 2.20) for 2 h/d, 1.70 (95{\%} CI 0.92 to 3.14) for 3 h/d, and 2.10 (95{\%} CI 1.27 to 3.47) for > or =4 h/d. Additional adjustment for physical activity or sedentary behavior minimally affected the ORs. DISCUSSION: Sedentary behavior is an important potential determinant of the prevalence of the syndrome. Efforts to lessen the amount of time that U.S. adults spend watching television or videos or using a computer, especially if coupled to increases in physical activity, could result in substantial decreases in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.},

The authors of this groundbreaking textbook demonstrate convincingly how the physical and social characteristics of a neighborhood can shape the health of its residents. Drawing on the expertise of a renowned cast of researchers, this book presents a state-of-the art account of the theories, methods, and empirical evidence linking neighborhood conditions to population health. Represented in the volume are contributions from the world's leading investigators in the field, including social epidemiologists, demographers, medical geographers, sociologists, and medical practitioners. This comprehensive textbook lays out for the first time the methodological approaches to conducting neighborhood research, including multi-level and contextual analysis, geocoding and the use of small area-based measures of deprivation, as well as the evolving science of "ecometrics." Substantive chapters present the case for the relevance of neighborhood effects on health outcomes throughout the life cycle, from infant mortality and low birthweight, to childhood asthma, adult infectious diseases, and disability in old age. The approaches covered in the book range from testing the linkages between community-level variables, such as social capital and residential segregation, and population health to designing and implementing community interventions and policies to improve the health of the public. The book is a timely companion volume to Social Epidemiology (Oxford University Press, 2000), edited by the same authors, and an indispensable manual on neighborhood research for students, researchers, and practitioners.},

We employed a statistical learning method - random forests - to examine which of the various weather variables had the greatest impact on heat-related mortality. We compiled a summertime daily weather and mortality counts dataset from four U.S. cities (Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI; Philadelphia, PA; and Phoenix, AZ) from 1998 to 2006. A variety of weather variables were ranked in predicting deviation from typical daily all-cause and cause-specific death counts. Ranks of weather variables varied with city and health outcome. Apparent temperature appeared to be the most important predictor of heat-related mortality for all-cause mortality. Absolute humidity was, on average, most frequently selected as one of the top variables for all-cause mortality and seven cause-specific mortality categories. Our analysis affirms that apparent temperature is a reasonable variable for activating heat alerts and warnings, which are commonly based on predictions of total mortality in next few days. Additionally, absolute humidity should be included in future heat-health studies. Finally, random forests can be used to guide the choice of weather variables in heat epidemiology studies.},

abstract = {Self-tracking has attracted a lot of attention from researchers and public opinion makers owing to its potential for improving life conditions through preemptive action on health, and as a tool of user empowerment vis-{\`{a}}-vis health-care professionals and private and public institutions. Nevertheless, the ‘stuff’ that is typically tracked – exercise and diet being the dominant tracking activities – refers to cultural and social practices that, for the individual user, are utterly mundane and reside in an experiential realm of everyday life. Self-tracking has to be understood in relation to behavior that is predominantly about getting things done in ways that are possible, suitable and meaningful for the individual. To account for this, we propose to conceptualize self-tracking as a communicative phenomenon along three dimensions: communication with the system, the self and social networks of peers. We develop the theoretical framework, drawing upon empirical findings from a qualitative study on how self-tra...},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measures of psychosocial constructs are required to assess dietary interventions. This study evaluated brief psychosocial scales related to 4 dietary behaviors (consumption of fat, fiber/whole grains, fruits, and vegetables).

METHODS: Two studies were conducted. Study 1 assessed two-week reliability of the psychosocial measures with a sample of 49 college students. Study 2 assessed convergent and discriminant validity of the psychosocial measures with dietary nutrient estimates from a Food Frequency Questionnaire on 441 men and 401 women enrolled in an Internet-based weight loss intervention study.

RESULTS: Study 1 test-retest reliability ICCs were strong and ranged from .63 to .79. In study 2, dietary fat cons, fiber/whole grain cons and self-efficacy, fruit and vegetable cons and self-efficacy, and healthy eating social support, environmental factors, enjoyment, and change strategies demonstrated adequate correlations with the corresponding dietary nutrient estimates.

CONCLUSIONS: Brief psychosocial measures related to dietary behaviors demonstrated adequate reliability and in most cases validity. The strongest and most consistent scales related to dietary behaviors were healthy eating change strategies and enjoyment. Consistent convergent validity was also found for the cons of change scales. These measures can be used in intervention studies to evaluate psychosocial mediators of dietary change in overweight and obese individuals.},

Worksite interventions designed to decrease sedentary time may serve to improve employee health. Objective The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and use of a pedal exercise machine for reducing workplace sedentary time. Methods Eighteen full-time employees (mean age+SD 40.2+10.7 years; 88{\%} female) working in sedentary occupations were recruited for participation. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected at baseline and 4 weeks. Participants were provided access to a pedal exercise machine for 4 weeks at work. Use of the device was measured objectively by exercise tracking software, which monitors pedal activity and provides the user real-time feedback (eg, speed, time, distance, calories). At 4 weeks, participants completed a feasibility questionnaire. Results Participants reported sitting 83{\%} of their working days. Participants used the pedal machines an average of 12.2+6.6 out of a possible 20 working days and pedalled an average of 23.4+20.4 min each day used. Feasibility data indicate that participants found the machines feasible for use at work. Participants also reported sedentary time at work decreased due to the machine. Discussion Findings from this study suggest that this pedal machine may be a feasible tool for reducing sedentary time while at work. These findings hold public health significance due to the growing number of sedentary jobs in the USA and the potential of the device for use in large-scale worksite health programmes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined parent-child attitudes on value of specific types and intensities of physical activity, which may explain gender differences in child activity, and evaluated physical activity as a mechanism to reduce time spent in sedentary behaviors. DESIGN: A community sample of 681 parents and 433 children (mean age 9.9 years) reported attitudes on importance of vigorous and moderate intensity team and individually performed sports/activities, as well as household chores. Separate structural models (LISREL 8.7) for girls and boys tested whether parental attitudes were related to child TV and computer via child attitudes, sport team participation, and physical activity, controlling for demographic factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Child 7-day physical activity, sport teams, weekly TV, computer. RESULTS: Parent-child attitude congruence was more prevalent among boys, and attitudes varied by ethnicity, parent education, and number of children. Positive parent-child attitudes for vigorous team sports were related to increased team participation and physical activity, as well as reduced TV and computer in boys and girls. Value of moderate intensity household chores, such as cleaning house and doing laundry, was related to decreased team participation and increased TV in boys. Only organized team sports, not general physical activity, was related to reduced TV and computer. CONCLUSION: Results support parents' role in socializing children's achievement task values, affecting child activity by transferring specific attitudes. Value of vigorous intensity sports provided the most benefits to activity and reduction of sedentary behavior, while valuing household chores had unexpected negative effects.},

abstract = {The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity and its concomitant health risks justify widespread efforts toward prevention. Although both diet and physical activity have been emphasized as appropriate interventions, the current paper focuses on the role of physical activity in obesity prevention. Children's levels of physical activity are highly variable, and may be influenced by a multitude of factors including physiological, psychological, sociocultural and environmental determinants. Although the relationship between physical activity and obesity is controversial and the protective mechanism unclear, physical activity is hypothesized to protect individuals from the development of obesity by increasing energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate (RMR) and leading to a favourable fuel utilization. The beneficial effect of physical activity in children is supported by controlled exercise intervention programs. Several broad-based public health interventions designed to increase children's levels of physical activity have been implemented in schools, families and communities, with results suggesting promising strategies for the prevention of childhood obesity. It is likely that successful prevention of childhood obesity through physical activity promotion will involve theory-based, culturally appropriate school, family and community interventions. Through policy changes, environmental planning and educational efforts in schools and communities, increased opportunities and encouragement for physical activity can be provided.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Low-fat high-carbohydrate diets are recommended to prevent weight gain in normal weight subjects and reduce body weight in overweight and obese. However, their efficacy is controversial. We evaluated the efficacy of ad libitum low-fat diets in reducing body weight in non-diabetic individuals from the results of intervention trials. DESIGN: Studies were identified from a computerized search of the Medline database from January 1966 to July 1999 and other sources. Inclusion criteria were: controlled trials lasting more than 2 months comparing ad libitum low-fat diets as the sole intervention with a control group consuming habitual diet or a medium-fat diet ad libitum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in changes in dietary fat intake, energy intake and body weight. Weighted mean differences for continuous data and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: Two authors independently selected the studies meeting the inclusion criteria and extracted data from 16 trials (duration of 2-12 months) with 19 intervention groups, enrolling 1910 individuals. Fourteen were randomized. Weight loss was not the primary aim in 11 studies. Before the interventions the mean proportions of dietary energy from fat in the studies were 37.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 36.9-38.5) in the low-fat groups, and 37.4{\%} (36.4-38.4) in the control groups. The low-fat intervention produced a mean fat reduction of 10.2{\%} (8.1-12.3). Low-fat intervention groups showed a greater weight loss than control groups (3.2 kg, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.9-4.5 kg; P < 0.0001), and a greater reduction in energy intake (1 138 kJ/day, 95{\%} confidence interval 564-1712 kJ/day, P = 0.002). Having a body weight 10 kg higher than the average pre-treatment body weight was associated with a 2.6 +/- 0.8 kg (P = 0.011) greater difference in weight loss. CONCLUSION: A reduction in dietary fat without intentional restriction of energy intake causes weight loss, which is more substantial in heavier subjects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physicians are expected to serve as role models for healthy lifestyles, but long work hours reduce time for healthy behaviors. A hospital-based physical activity intervention could improve physician health and increase counseling about exercise.

METHODS: We conducted a two-phase intervention among 104 medical residents at a large hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Phase 1 was a 6-week randomized controlled trial comparing daily steps of residents assigned to an activity monitor displaying feedback about steps and energy consumed (intervention) or to a blinded monitor (control). Phase 2 immediately followed and was a 6-week non-randomized team steps competition in which all participants wore monitors with feedback. Phase 1 outcomes were: 1) median steps/day and 2) proportion of days activity monitor worn. The Phase 2 outcome was mean steps/day on days monitor worn (≥500 steps/day). Physiologic measurements were collected at baseline and study end. Median steps/day were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Mean steps were compared using repeated measures regression analyses.

RESULTS: In Phase 1, intervention and control groups had similar activity (6369 vs. 6063 steps/day, p = 0.16) and compliance with wearing the monitor (77{\%} vs. 77{\%} of days, p = 0.73). In Phase 2 (team competition), residents recorded more steps/day than during Phase 1 (CONTROL: 7,971 vs. 7,567, p = 0.002;

INTERVENTION: 7,832 vs. 7,739, p = 0.13). Mean compliance with wearing the activity monitor decreased for both groups during Phase 2 compared to Phase 1 (60{\%} vs. 77{\%}, p<0.001). Mean systolic blood pressure decreased (p = 0.004) and HDL cholesterol increased (p<0.001) among all participants at end of study compared to baseline.

CONCLUSIONS: Although the activity monitor intervention did not have a major impact on activity or health, the high participation rates of busy residents and modest changes in steps, blood pressure, and HDL suggest that more intensive hospital-based wellness programs have potential for promoting healthier lifestyles among physicians.

This technology has the potential to be used in automated activity profiling systems which produce a continuous record of activity patterns over extended periods of time. Such activity profiling systems are dependent on classification algorithms which can effectively interpret body-worn sensor data and identify different activities. This article reviews the different techniques which have been used to classify normal activities and/or identify falls from body-worn sensor data. The review is structured according to the different analytical techniques and illustrates the variety of approaches which have previously been applied in this field. Although significant progress has been made in this important area, there is still significant scope for further work, particularly in the application of advanced classification techniques to problems involving many different activities.},

abstract = {A growing body of evidence links the built environment to physical activity levels, health outcomes, and transportation behaviors. However, little of this research has focused on cycling, a sustainable transportation option with great potential for growth in North America. This study examines associations between decisions to bicycle (versus drive) and the built environment, with explicit consideration of three different spatial zones that may be relevant in travel behavior: trip origins, trip destinations, and along the route between. We analyzed 3,280 utilitarian bicycle and car trips in Metro Vancouver, Canada made by 1,902 adults, including both current and potential cyclists. Objective measures were developed for built environment characteristics related to the physical environment, land use patterns, the road network, and bicycle-specific facilities. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the likelihood that a trip was made by bicycle, adjusting for trip distance and personal demographics. Separate models were constructed for each spatial zone, and a global model examined the relative influence of the three zones. In total, 31{\%} (1,023 out of 3,280) of trips were made by bicycle. Increased odds of bicycling were associated with less hilliness; higher intersection density; less highways and arterials; presence of bicycle signage, traffic calming, and cyclist-activated traffic lights; more neighborhood commercial, educational, and industrial land uses; greater land use mix; and higher population density. Different factors were important within each spatial zone. Overall, the characteristics of routes were more influential than origin or destination characteristics. These findings indicate that the built environment has a significant influence on healthy travel decisions, and spatial context is important. Future research should explicitly consider relevant spatial zones when investigating the relationship between physical activity and urban form.},

Commercial outlet data were linked by zip code to US Census Bureau population and socioeconomic data. RESULTS: Results showed that commercial physical activity-related facilities were less likely to be present in lower-income neighborhoods and in neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents, residents with His-panic ethnicity, and residents of other racial minority backgrounds. In addition, these neighborhoods had fewer such facilities available. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of availability of facilities that enable and promote physical activity may, in part, underpin the lower levels of activity observed among populations of low socioeconomic status and minority backgrounds.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the volume and intensity of children's physical activity after school in greenspace and elsewhere. METHODS: Data were collected between 2006 and 2008 from 1,307 children aged 10-11 in Bristol, UK. Accelerometers and Global Positioning System receivers measured activity and location every 10 s (epoch) after school for four days. Data were mapped in a Geographic Information System with a greenspace dataset. Activity volume (accelerometer counts per minute), time in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and the odds of an epoch being MVPA (using logistic regression) were compared for greenspace, non-greenspace and indoors. RESULTS: 13{\%} of monitored time was spent outdoors (2{\%} in greenspace), during which time 30{\%} of activity volume and 35{\%} of MVPA was accumulated. 7{\%} of boys' activity volume and 9{\%} of MVPA were in greenspace with girls slightly lower (5{\%} and 6{\%} respectively). The odds of an epoch being MVPA in greenspace relative to outdoor non-greenspace was 1.37 (95{\%} CI 1.22-1.53) for boys and 1.08 (95{\%} CI 0.95-1.22) for girls. CONCLUSION: Most activity occurring outdoors is not in greenspace and non-green urban environments are therefore very important for children's activity. However, when boys are in greenspace, activity is more likely to be of higher intensity.},

abstract = {Big data is often seen in terms of powerful institutions managing the actions of populations through data. This ethnography of the Quantified Self movement, where participants collect extensive data about their own bodies, identifies practices that go beyond simply internalizing predetermined frameworks. The QS movement attracts the most hungrily panoptical of the data aggregation businesses in addition to people who have developed their own notions of analytics that are separate from, and in relation to, dominant practices of firms and institutionalized scientific production. Their practices constitute an important modality of resistance to dominant modes of living with data, an approach that we call “soft resistance.” Soft resistance happens when participants assume multiple roles as project designers, data collectors, and critical sense-makers who rapidly shift priorities. This constant shifting keeps data sets fragmented and thus creates material resistance to traditional modes of data aggregation. It also breaks the categories that make traditional aggregations appear authoritative. This enables participants to partially yet significantly escape the frames created by the biopolitics of the health technology industry. I},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In the general population, attention is reliably enhanced after exposure to certain physical environments, particularly natural environments. This study examined the impacts of environments on attention in children with ADHD. METHOD: In this within subjects design, each participant experienced each of three treatments (environments) in single blind controlled trials. Seventeen children 7 to 12 years old professionally diagnosed with ADHD experienced each of three environments-a city park and two other well-kept urban settings-via individually guided 20-minute walks. Environments were experienced 1 week apart, with randomized assignment to treatment order. After each walk, concentration was measured using Digit Span Backwards. RESULTS: Children with ADHD concentrated better after the walk in the park than after the downtown walk (p = .0229) or the neighborhood walk (p = .0072). Effect sizes were substantial (Cohen's d =.52 and .77, respectively) and comparable to those reported for recent formulations of methylphenidate. CONCLUSION: Twenty minutes in a park setting was sufficient to elevate attention performance relative to the same amount of time in other settings. These findings indicate that environments can enhance attention not only in the general population but also in ADHD populations. "Doses of nature" might serve as a safe, inexpensive, widely accessible new tool in the tool kit for managing ADHD symptoms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although attempted weight loss is common, little is known about the goals and durations of weight loss attempts and the rates of achieved weight loss in the general population. METHODS: Data were collected by telephone in 1989 from adults aged 18 years and older in 39 states and the District of Columbia. Analyses were carried out separately for the 6758 men and 14,915 women who reported currently trying to lose weight. RESULTS: Approximately 25{\%} of the men respondents and 40{\%} of the women respondents reported that they were currently trying to lose weight. Among men, a higher percentage of Hispanics (31{\%}) than of Whites (25{\%}) or Blacks (23{\%}) reported trying to lose weight. Among women, however, there were no ethnic differences in prevalence. The average man wanted to lose 30 pounds and to weigh 178 pounds; the average woman wanted to lose 31 pounds and to weigh 133 pounds. Black women wanted to lose an average of 8 pounds more than did White women, but Black women's goal weight was 10 pounds heavier. The average rate of achieved weight loss was 1.4 pounds per week for men and 1.1 pounds per week for women; these averages, however, may reflect only the experience of those most successful at losing weight. CONCLUSIONS: Attempted weight loss is a common behavior, regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity, and weight loss goals are substantial; however, obesity remains a major public health problem in the United States.},

abstract = {The availability of well-characterized neuroimaging data with large numbers of subjects, especially for clinical populations, is critical to advancing our understanding of the healthy and diseased brain. Such data enables questions to be answered in a much more generalizable manner and also has the potential to yield solutions derived from novel methods that were conceived after the original studies' implementation. Though there is currently growing interest in data sharing, the neuroimaging community has been struggling for years with how to best encourage sharing data across brain imaging studies. With the advent of studies that are much more consistent across sites (e.g., resting functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural imaging) the potential of pooling data across studies continues to gain momentum. At the mind research network, we have developed the collaborative informatics and neuroimaging suite (COINS; http://coins.mrn.org) to provide researchers with an information system based on an open-source model that includes web-based tools to manage studies, subjects, imaging, clinical data, and other assessments. The system currently hosts data from nine institutions, over 300 studies, over 14,000 subjects, and over 19,000 MRI, MEG, and EEG scan sessions in addition to more than 180,000 clinical assessments. In this paper we provide a description of COINS with comparison to a valuable and popular system known as XNAT. Although there are many similarities between COINS and other electronic data management systems, the differences that may concern researchers in the context of multi-site, multi-organizational data sharing environments with intuitive ease of use and PHI security are emphasized as important attributes.},

abstract = {Just as translational medicine follows a long winding path from bench-to-bedside, so can Evidence-Based Medicine be envisioned as comprising a multi-step pipeline, from building evidence from raw data through synthesizing best practices and providing clinical decision support in a process described as the "evidence pyramid". 1 At one end, a heterogeneous mix of clinical and experimental studies including clinical trials, case reports, animal models and retrospective analyses are published as new knowledge. Then, experts collect and assess high-quality relevant evidence on specific issues and publish their conclusions (e.g., regarding efficacy and safety of treatments) as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Finally, when an expert consensus has been reached, this must reach the attention of policy makers within the profession, the government and insurance companies, resulting in new practice guidelines and altered clinical practice within hospitals and clinics. At each stage, this process requires a large investment of time and effort from many individuals with a wide range of expertise. Our panel will discuss the variety of innovative approaches that are being taken by different informatics research groups to improve each step within the evidence based medicine pipeline. These approaches are, in part, devoted to making existing data collection and synthesis practices faster and more efficient, but they also involve re-imagining and re-engineering the processes by which evidence is accumulated, evaluated and applied.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Using the prediction of cancer outcome as a model, we have tested the hypothesis that through analysing routinely collected digital data contained in an electronic administrative record (EAR), using machine-learning techniques, we could enhance conventional methods in predicting clinical outcomes.

SETTING: A regional cancer centre in Australia.

PARTICIPANTS: Disease-specific data from a purpose-built cancer registry (Evaluation of Cancer Outcomes (ECO)) from 869 patients were used to predict survival at 6, 12 and 24 months. The model was validated with data from a further 94 patients, and results compared to the assessment of five specialist oncologists. Machine-learning prediction using ECO data was compared with that using EAR and a model combining ECO and EAR data.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival prediction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

RESULTS: The ECO model yielded AUCs of 0.87 (95{\%} CI 0.848 to 0.890) at 6 months, 0.796 (95{\%} CI 0.774 to 0.823) at 12 months and 0.764 (95{\%} CI 0.737 to 0.789) at 24 months. Each was slightly better than the performance of the clinician panel. The model performed consistently across a range of cancers, including rare cancers. Combining ECO and EAR data yielded better prediction than the ECO-based model (AUCs ranging from 0.757 to 0.997 for 6 months, AUCs from 0.689 to 0.988 for 12 months and AUCs from 0.713 to 0.973 for 24 months). The best prediction was for genitourinary, head and neck, lung, skin, and upper gastrointestinal tumours.

CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning applied to information from a disease-specific (cancer) database and the EAR can be used to predict clinical outcomes. Importantly, the approach described made use of digital data that is already routinely collected but underexploited by clinical health systems.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the accuracy of three self-administered food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to measure dietary calcium intake in healthy adults. DESIGN: Estimates of dietary calcium intake from one previously validated and two recently developed FFQs were compared with those from 7-day food records. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Healthy adults enrolled in an outpatient study of calcium supplementation completed the 36-page Dietary History Questionnaire (DHQ), a 3-page Calcium Questionnaire, and a 1-page Short Calcium Questionnaire. Subjects then completed a 7-day food record. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences between calcium intake reported on FFQs and calcium intake from food records were compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Spearman correlations were used to measure associations among variables; Bland-Altman pairwise comparisons were conducted to assess systematic and magnitude biases. RESULTS: We studied 341 subjects, 74.5{\%} female, mean (+/-standard deviation) age of 38+/-11 years and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) of 31.8+/-7.1. Mean (+/-standard deviation) food record calcium intake was 896+/-380 mg/day; data from all three FFQs were positively related to food record calcium intake, but accounted for <40{\%} of the variance in food record dietary calcium intake (DHQ: r(2)=0.21; Calcium Questionnaire: r(2)=0.33; Short Calcium Questionnaire: r(2)=0.37; all P<0.001). The DHQ underestimated daily calcium intake (systematic bias: -94 mg/day, P<0.001; magnitude bias r=-0.40; P<0.001), whereas the Calcium Questionnaire overestimated calcium intake (systematic bias +177 mg/day, P<0.001), but had no significant magnitude bias (r=-0.09; P=0.11). The Short Calcium Questionnaire showed minimal systematic bias (+34 mg/day, P=0.09), but had magnitude bias (r=-0.33; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: All three FFQs performed reasonably well at estimating dietary calcium intake compared to food records; each may be appropriate for use in select clinical and research settings.},

Ninety studies published in English language journals between 1949 and 2004 were included, presenting data from 539 independent samples (the unit of analysis). Results suggest contemporary youth watch on average 1.8-2.8 h of TV per day, depending on age and gender. Most (66{\%}) are "low users" (< 2 h day(-1)) of TV but 28{\%} watch more than 4 h day(-1). Boys and girls with access to video games spend approximately 60 and 23 min day(-1), respectively, using this technology. Computer use accounts for an additional 30 min day(-1). Age-specific data suggest TV viewing decreases during adolescence, but those considered "high users" at young ages are likely to remain high users when older. For children with access to a television set, the number of hours spent viewing does not appear to have increased over the past 50 years.},

abstract = {Step counting (using pedometers or accelerometers) is widely accepted by researchers, practitioners, and the general public. Given the mounting evidence of the link between low steps/day and time spent in sedentary behaviours, how few steps/day some populations actually perform, and the growing interest in the potentially deleterious effects of excessive sedentary behaviours on health, an emerging question is "How many steps/day are too few?" This review examines the utility, appropriateness, and limitations of using a reoccurring candidate for a step-defined sedentary lifestyle index: <5000 steps/day. Adults taking <5000 steps/day are more likely to have a lower household income and be female, older, of African-American vs. European-American heritage, a current vs. never smoker, and (or) living with chronic disease and (or) disability. Little is known about how contextual factors (e.g., built environment) foster such low levels of step-defined physical activity. Unfavorable indicators of body composition and cardiometabolic risk have been consistently associated with taking <5000 steps/day. The acute transition (3-14 days) of healthy active young people from higher (>10 000) to lower (<5000 or as low as 1500) daily step counts induces reduced insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, increased adiposity, and other negative changes in health parameters. Although few alternative values have been considered, the continued use of <5000 steps/day as a step-defined sedentary lifestyle index for adults is appropriate for researchers and practitioners and for communicating with the general public. There is little evidence to advocate any specific value indicative of a step-defined sedentary lifestyle index in children and adolescents.},

abstract = {Despite much progress with physical activity assessment, the limitations concerning the accurate measurement of physical activity are often amplified in young people due to the cognitive, physiological, and biomechanical changes that occur during natural growth as well as a more intermittent pattern of habitual physical activity in youth compared with adults. This mini-review describes and compares methods to assess habitual physical activity in youth and discusses main issues regarding the use and interpretation of data collected with these techniques. Self-report instruments and movement sensing are currently the most frequently used methods for the assessment of physical activity in epidemiological research; others include heart rate monitoring and multisensor systems. Habitual energy expenditure can be estimated from these input measures with varying degree of uncertainty. Nonlinear modeling techniques, using accelerometry perhaps in combination with physiological parameters like heart rate or temperature, have the greatest potential for increasing the prediction accuracy of habitual physical activity energy expenditure. Although multisensor systems may be more accurate, this must be balanced against feasibility, a balance that shifts with technological and scientific advances and should be considered at the beginning of every new study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an active school model on children's physical activity (PA). DESIGN: 16-month cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 10 elementary schools in Greater Vancouver, BC. PARTICIPANTS: 515 children aged 9-11 years. INTERVENTION: Action Schools! BC (AS! BC) is an active school model that provided schools with training and resources to increase children's PA. Schools implemented AS! BC with support from either external liaisons (liaison schools, LS; four schools) or internal champions (champion schools, CS; three schools). Outcomes were compared with usual practice (UP) schools (three schools). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: PA was measured four times during the study using pedometers (step count, steps/day). RESULTS: Boys in the LS group took 1175 more steps per day, on average, than boys in the UP group (95{\%} CI: 97 to 2253). Boys in the CS group also tended to have a higher step count than boys in the UP group (+804 steps/day; 95{\%} CI: -341 to 1949). There was no difference in girls' step counts across groups. CONCLUSIONS: The positive effect of the AS! BC model on boys' PA is important in light of the current global trend of decreased PA.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Laboratory studies of adult walking behavior have consistently found that a cadence of 100 steps/min is a reasonable threshold for moderate intensity. The purpose of this study was to determine cadence patterns in free-living adults, and in particular, time spent at increasing cadence increments including 100 steps/min and beyond.

METHOD: 3744 adults ≥20 years provided at least one valid day (minimally 10/24 h of wear) of minute-by-minute accelerometer-determined step data during the 2005-2006 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Means for time spent (min/day) and steps/day were calculated for 8 cadence categories including zero and each incremental cadence band thereafter beginning with 1-19 through 100-119, and beyond to 120+steps/min.

RESULTS: U.S. adults accumulate ≅4.8 h/day of zero cadence during wearing time, ≅8.7 h between 1 and 59 steps/min, ≅16 min/day at cadences of 60-79 steps/min, ≅8 min at 80-99 steps/min, ≅5 min at 100-119 steps/min, and ≅2 min at 120+steps/min.

CONCLUSION: Self-selected walking at 100+steps/min was a rare phenomenon in this large free-living sample of the U.S. population, but study participants did accumulate ≅30 min/day at cadences of 60+steps/min.},

@article{Beets2010a,
abstract = {CONTEXT: Insufficient physical activity among young people aged 5-18 years is a global public health issue, with considerable disparities among countries. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies reporting pedometer daily steps (steps x day(-1)) in order to compile comparative, global cross-sectional data on youth physical activity patterns. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Articles were included if they were in English, published by April 2009, and reported steps x day(-1) for boys and girls, separately, and reported steps x day(-1) for age groupings of no more than 4 years (e.g., 5-8 years) or combined no more than three grade levels (e.g., third- to fifth-graders). Studies could have been intervention-based but had to have reported baseline steps x day(-1), which would reflect unadulterated physical activity steps x day(-1) estimates. Inverse variance weighted estimates (steps x day(-1w)) were calculated for each country, and random effects models were estimated. Analyses were conducted in May and June 2009. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Forty-three studies, representing young people in 13 countries (N=14,200), were included. The majority of studies were from the U.S. (17/43). Overall, there was considerable variation within and among countries in steps x day(-1w). Boys and girls from European and Western Pacific regions had significantly more steps x day(-1w) than young people from the U.S. and Canada. Significantly lower steps x day(-1w) estimates for girls were observed for studies that combined measured steps x day(-1) for weekdays and weekend days, in comparison to weekdays only. CONCLUSIONS: Limited sample sizes and non-population-based data preclude definitive statements regarding projected steps x day(-1) within countries. Nevertheless, these findings provide preliminary information for policymakers and researchers on the extent of the disparities among countries in the physical activity patterns of young people.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The primary objective was to determine the dose-response relation between screen time (television + computer) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in adolescents. METHODS: The study sample included 1803 adolescents (12-19 years) from the 1999-04 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Average daily screen time (combined television, computer and video game use) was self-reported. MetS was defined according to adolescent criteria linked to the adult criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (> or =3 of high triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high waist circumference, high blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol). RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant covariates, the odds ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) for MetS increased in a dose-response manner (P(trend) < 0.01) across < or =1 h/day (1.00, referent), 2 h/day (1.21, 0.54-2.73), 3 h/day (2.16, 0.99-4.74), 4 h/day (1.73, 0.72-4.17) and > or =5 h/day (3.07, 1.48-6.34) screen time categories. Physical activity had a minimal impact on the relation between screen time and MetS. CONCLUSIONS: Screen time was associated with an increased likelihood of MetS in a dose-dependent manner independent of physical activity. These findings suggest that lifestyle-based public health interventions for youth should include a specific component aimed at reducing screen time.},

abstract = {Objectives. To examine associations between obesity and occupational injury. Methods. Participants consisted of a representative sample of 7,678 adult Canadian workers. Participants were placed into normal weight, overweight, and obese categories based on their body mass index. Different injury types, location, and external causes were measured. Logistic regression was used to estimate relationships. Results. By comparison to normal weight workers, obese workers were more likely to report any occupational injuries (odds ratio (OR) 1.40, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.99) and serious occupational injuries (1.49, 0.99-2.26). These relationships were more pronounced for sprains and strains (1.80, 1.04-3.11), injuries to the lower limbs (2.14, 1.12-4.11) or torso (2.36, 1.13-4.93), and injuries due to falls (2.10, 0.86-5.10) or overexertion (2.08, 0.96-4.50). Female workers, workers ≥40 years, and workers employed in sedentary occupations were particularly vulnerable. Increased risks were not identified for overweight workers. Conclusions. Obese workers experienced 40-49{\%} higher risks for occupational injury.},

Therefore, new methods of quantifying the physical activity habits of communities were developed which are practical for large health surveys, provide information on the distribution of activity habits in the population, can detect changes in activity over time, and can be compared with other epidemiologic studies of physical activity. Independent self-reports of vigorous activity (at least 6 metabolic equivalents (METs) ), moderate activity (3-5 METs), and total energy expenditure (kilocalories per day) are described, and the physical activity practices of samples of California cities are presented. Relationships between physical activity measures and age, education, occupation, ethnicity, marital status, and body mass index are analyzed, and the reliabilities of the three activity indices are reported. The new assessment procedure is contrasted with nine other measures of physical activity used in community surveys.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization estimates that 1.9 million deaths worldwide are attributable to physical inactivity. Chronic diseases associated with physical inactivity include cancer, diabetes and coronary heart disease. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence of the effectiveness of school-based interventions in promoting physical activity and fitness in children and adolescents. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy included searching several databases. In addition, reference lists of included articles and background papers were reviewed for potentially relevant studies, as well as references from relevant Cochrane reviews. Primary authors of included studies were contacted as needed for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA: To be included, the intervention had to be relevant to public health practice, implemented, facilitated, or promoted by staff in local public health units, implemented in a school setting and aimed at increasing physical activity, report on outcomes for children and adolescents (aged 6 to 18 years), and use a prospective design with a control group. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Standardized tools were used by two independent reviewers to rate each study's methodological quality and for data extraction. Where discrepancies existed discussion occurred until consensus was reached. The results were summarized narratively due to wide variations in the populations, interventions evaluated and outcomes measured. MAIN RESULTS: 13,841 titles were identified and screened and 482 articles were retrieved. Multiple publications on the same project were combined and counted as one project, resulting in 395 distinct project accounts (studies). Of the 395 studies 104 were deemed relevant and of those, four were assessed as having strong methodological quality, 22 were of moderate quality and 78 were considered weak. In total 26 studies were included in the review. There is good evidence that school-based physical activity interventions have a positive impact on four of the nine outcome measures. Specifically positive effects were observed for duration of physical activity, television viewing, VO2 max, and blood cholesterol. Generally school-based interventions had no effect on leisure time physical activity rates, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and pulse rate. At a minimum, a combination of printed educational materials and changes to the school curriculum that promote physical activity result in positive effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given that there are no harmful effects and that there is some evidence of positive effects on lifestyle behaviours and physical health status measures, ongoing physical activity promotion in schools is recommended at this time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The acculturation hypothesis proposes an overall disadvantage in health outcomes for Hispanic immigrants with more time spent living in the U.S., but little is known about how generational status and language may influence Hispanic children's relative weight and activity patterns. PURPOSE: To investigate associations among generation and language with relative weight (BMI z-scores), physical activity, screen time, and participation in extracurricular activities (i.e., sports, clubs) in a U.S.-based, nationally representative sample of Hispanic children. METHODS: Participants included 2012 Hispanic children aged 6-11 years from the cross-sectional 2003 National Survey of Children's Health. Children were grouped according to generational status (first, second, or third), and the primary language spoken in the home (English versus non-English). Primary analyses included adjusted logistic and multinomial logistic regression to examine the relationships among variables; all analyses were conducted between 2008 and 2009. RESULTS: Compared to third-generation, English speakers, first- and second-generation, non-English speakers were more than two times more likely to be obese. Moreover, first-generation, non-English speakers were half as likely to engage in regular physical activity and sports. Both first- and second-generation, non-English speakers were less likely to participate in clubs compared to second- and third-generation, English speakers. Overall, non-English-speaking groups reported less screen time compared to third-generation, English speakers. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that Hispanics lose their health protection with more time spent in the U.S. was not supported in this sample of Hispanic children.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Childhood overweight and obesity is a major public health issue. A better understanding of factors associated with sedentary behaviours would provide valuable insight for tailoring interventions to prevent or reduce overweight among youth. METHODS: Data were collected from 25,416 grade 9 to 12 students attending 76 secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, using the Physical Activity Module of the School Health Action, Planning and Evaluation System (SHAPES). Sex specific multivariate logistic regression analyses were then used to examine how physical activity, BMI, social influences, and smoking behaviour were associated with screen time, time spent reading, and time spent on homework. RESULTS: The average screen time per day was 2.7 (+/-1.7) hours, yet 48.1{\%} of students reported spending less than one hour reading per week and 30.2{\%} spent less than an hour of time on homework per week. Among males, being underweight (< or = 5{\%} percentile BMI, adjusted for age and sex) was associated with more screen time (OR 1.23, 95{\%}CI 1.01-1.50) and time spent reading (OR 1.19, 95{\%}CI 1.00-1.43), whereas being at risk of overweight (> or = 85{\%} percentile BMI, adjusted for age and sex) was associated with less time spent on homework (OR 0.75, 95{\%}CI 0.65-0.85). Conversely, among females, being at risk of overweight was associated with more screen time (OR 1.24, 95{\%}CI 1.10-1.41), and time spent reading (OR 1.19, 95{\%}CI 1.05-1.35). Aside from BMI, other factors associated with sedentary behaviours included physical activity, parental encouragement and support for physical activity, close friend physical activity behaviour, and smoking status. DISCUSSION: We found that students are highly involved in screen-based sedentary behaviours, but spend a limited time on more productive sedentary behaviours, like reading and homework. Developing a better understanding of sedentary behaviours is critical for preventing and reducing obesity among youth populations.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the 'activPAL Professional' physical activity logger by comparing its output to that of a proven discrete accelerometer-based activity monitor during extended measurements on healthy subjects while performing activities of daily living (ADL). Ten healthy adults, with unrestricted mobility, wore both the activPAL and the discrete dual accelerometer (Analog Devices ADXL202)-based activity monitor that recorded in synchronization with each other. The accelerometer derived data were then compared to that generated by the activPAL and a complete statistical and error analysis was performed using a Matlab program. This program determined trunk and thigh inclination angles to distinguish between sitting/lying, standing and stepping for the discrete accelerometer device and amount of time spent on each activity. Analysis was performed on a second-by-second basis and then categorized at 15s intervals in direct comparison with the activPAL generated data. Of the total time monitored (approximately 60 h) the detection accuracies for static and dynamic activities were approximately 98{\%}. In a population of healthy adults, the data obtained from the activPAL Professional physical activity logger for both static and dynamic activities showed a close match to a proven discrete accelerometer data with an offset of approximately 2{\%} between the two systems.},

abstract = {Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are web-based and mobile interventions intended to support patients and consumers in changing behaviors related to health, mental health, and well-being. BITs are provided to patients and consumers in clinical care settings and commercial marketplaces, frequently with little or no evaluation. Current evaluation methods, including RCTs and implementation studies, can require years to validate an intervention. This timeline is fundamentally incompatible with the BIT environment, where technology advancement and changes in consumer expectations occur quickly, necessitating rapidly evolving interventions. However, BITs can routinely and iteratively collect data in a planned and strategic manner and generate evidence through systematic prospective analyses, thereby creating a system that can "learn." A methodologic framework, Continuous Evaluation of Evolving Behavioral Intervention Technologies (CEEBIT), is proposed that can support the evaluation of multiple BITs or evolving versions, eliminating those that demonstrate poorer outcomes, while allowing new BITs to be entered at any time. CEEBIT could be used to ensure the effectiveness of BITs provided through deployment platforms in clinical care organizations or BIT marketplaces. The features of CEEBIT are described, including criteria for the determination of inferiority, determination of BIT inclusion, methods of assigning consumers to BITs, definition of outcomes, and evaluation of the usefulness of the system. CEEBIT offers the potential to collapse initial evaluation and postmarketing surveillance, providing ongoing assurance of safety and efficacy to patients and consumers, payers, and policymakers.},

abstract = {Habitual behavior is often hard to change because of a lack of self-monitoring skills. Digital technologies offer an unprecedented chance to facilitate self-monitoring by delivering feedback on undesired habitual behavior. This review analyzed the results of 72 studies in which feedback from digital technology attempted to disrupt and change undesired habits. A vast majority of these studies found that feedback through digital technology is an effective way to disrupt habits, regardless of target behavior or feedback technology used. Unfortunately, methodological issues limit our confidence in the findings of all but 14 of the 50 studies with quantitative measurements in this review. Furthermore, only 4 studies tested for (and only 3 of those 4 found) sustained habit change, and it remains unclear how feedback from digital technology is moderated by receiver states and traits, as well as feedback characteristics such as feedback sign, comparison, tailoring, modality, frequency, timing and duration. We conclude with recommendations for new research directions.},

abstract = {This study followed a predominantly qualitative approach to explore the perspectives of employers in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, call centres (CCs) regarding physical activity (PA) promotion in workplaces, by identifying current practices and employers' motivation to promote PA, as well as perceived facilitators and barriers. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 managers in 10 of 12 local CCs and questionnaires were used to collect quantitative information about participants and their workplaces. Thematic analysis revealed that participants' responses to recommendations for PA promotion were generally positive and some CCs were engaged in some PA initiatives. Employers' motivations to promote PA included direct benefits to the employer, concern for employee well-being and the greater good. Barriers to PA promotion within CCs included the nature of CC work, managers' concerns regarding participation, fairness and cost and special limitations of the workspace. Results indicate additional actions and supports are required to facilitate implementation of PA in CCs according to governmental recommendations. Efforts are required to increase awareness and use of existing resources. Smaller organizations may require more assistance to promote PA than those with a larger number of employees and may benefit from enhanced interaction with existing networks and public health programs and resources.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is important for older adults to be physically active, but many older adults walk slowly. This study examined the accuracy of a commercially available step-count device (Fitbit One) at slow speeds and compared the accuracy of the device when worn at the ankle and waist in older adults.

METHODS: The Fitbit One was placed at the ankle and waist of participants (n=42; mean age 73 years) while they performed walking trials at 7 different speeds (0.3-0.9 m/s). Step counts obtained from video recordings were used as the gold standard comparison to determine the accuracy of the device.

RESULTS: The ankle-worn device had significantly less error than the waist-worn device at all speeds. The percentage error of the ankle-worn device was less than 10{\%} at speeds of 0.4-0.9 m/s and did not record zero steps at any speed. The percentage error of the waist-worn device was below 10{\%} at only the 2 fastest speeds (0.8 and 0.9 m/s) and recorded zero steps for numerous participants at speeds of 0.3-0.5 m/s.

CONCLUSION: The Fitbit One can accurately capture steps at slow speeds when placed at the ankle and thus may be appropriate for capturing physical activity in slow-walking older adults.},

This pilot study aimed to determine the acute effects of an Australian government-sponsored TV advertisement (called 'Get Moving'), promoting more physical activity and less sedentary behaviour, on children's choices, preferences, and ratings of liking for physical activities and sedentary behaviours. Thirty-one children aged 10-12 years were recruited from a single public school, and randomised to one of two treatment groups or two control groups (Solomon four-group design). Treatment participants watched an episode of The Simpsons embedded every 10min with three 30s Get Moving advertisements plus standard advertisements. Control participants watched the same episode plus standard advertisements, but without the Get Moving advertisements. The following dependent variables were assessed immediately before and/or after exposure: activity preference (participants selected either verbally or by pointing to one of eight picture cards depicting four physical activities and four sedentary behaviours); ratings of liking (participants rated how much they liked or disliked each of these activities/behaviours either verbally or by pointing to one of nine values with an adjacent smile or frown on a Likert-type scale); and time spent in physical activities was assessed by direct observation during a 10min free-time session. No significant effects or trends were seen for any of the dependent variables. Further research is needed to determine whether different content and/or higher doses of exposure to physical activity promoting advertisements are needed to influence children's activity choices.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the proportion of children's physical activity occurring in public parks with playgrounds. METHODS: Children (n=184) aged 5 to 10 years were recruited from schools located in two low socio-economic status communities in Dunedin, New Zealand. Accelerometers (Actigraph GT1M) and global positioning system units (Globalsat DG-100) were used to quantify and identify where physical activity had occurred over a 7-day period. Cross-sectional data were collected October to December 2007 (southern hemisphere spring) and the child's height and weight were measured at school. RESULTS: At least 84{\%} of participants had accelerometer and global positioning system data available for five or more hourly periods per day, for at least 4 days. Overall, 1.9{\%} of recorded activity took place at city parks (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.4, 2.4), although this was 2.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence intervals: 0.7, 4.6) among obese children. CONCLUSIONS: Accelerometers and GPS data was able to be successfully recorded and matched among this age group. The proportion of children's activity taking place in parks with playgrounds was low, although this may still be important for some subgroups.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The long-term role that parental encouragement and attitudes about fitness and exercise play in adolescents' physical activity and sedentary behavior habits remains unclear. This paper aims to longitudinally examine how parental encouragement to be physically active and parental concern about staying fit are associated with adolescents' physical activity and sedentary behavior habits five years later. METHODS: Project EAT-II adolescent and young adult participants (1130 male, 1386 female) completed surveys while in middle school or high school (1998-1999), and again 5 years later. Participants were asked whether their mother and father encourage them to be physically active and care about staying fit and exercising. Adolescent moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and TV/video watching (hours/week) were assessed. Linear regression models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics and baseline behavior were used to examine the association of Time 1 parental factors with behavioral outcomes among adolescents and young adults five years later (Time 2). RESULTS: After adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics and baseline MVPA, adolescent-reported maternal and paternal encouragement to be active, and paternal care for fitness, were positively associated with weekly hours of MVPA after five years in young adult males (p for trend .01). The positive relationship between maternal encouragement and MVPA approached significance among high-school aged females (p for trend = .06), and paternal encouragement was positively related to MVPA among high-school aged males (p for trend = .02). While maternal encouragement to be active was associated with decreased TV/video time among younger females (p for trend = .02), other parental factors were not associated with lower TV/video time among the other groups. CONCLUSION: Parental encouragement to be active was associated with increased physical activity among males and younger females 5 years later. Younger adolescents appear to be especially influenced by their same-sex parent. These findings suggest that encouragement may be more influential than parental concern for fitness on adolescents' physical activity habits. Further research is needed to determine how parents can help adolescents decrease sedentary behavior time.},

abstract = {Hypothesis:Physically active occupations may protect against the risk of abdominal obesity.Objectives:This study assessed the interaction between non-occupational physical activity (NOA) (leisure-time, transport and domestic activity) and occupational activity (OA) in relation to abdominal obesity.Methods:A total of 3539 adults over the age of 20, with no work limitations, employed in one of the 17 occupations classified as low OA (LOA) or high OA (HOA) were identified in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Waist circumference (WC) was used to categorize individuals into either non-obese or abdominally obese (WC>88 cm in women and >102 cm in men) categories. NOA was divided into three categories based upon physical activity guidelines: (1) no NOA; (2) insufficient NOA; and (3) sufficient NOA. Logistic regression was used to examine possible associations between NOA, OA and abdominal obesity.Results:In those who are sedentary outside of work, a high-activity occupation reduces the odds risk ratio of being categorized with abdominal obesity to 0.37 in comparison with those who work in low-activity occupations. For people working in low-activity occupations, there was a clear association with activity outside of work and the odds risk ratio of being categorized with abdominal obesity. In these adults, a reduced odds ratio was found only among those who met the physical activity guidelines through NOA (odds ratio=0.55; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=0.40-0.75).Conclusion:HOA is associated with a reduced risk of abdominal obesity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the current levels of physical education (PE) and sports participation among American secondary school students, and to establish the extent to which they vary by grade level, racial/ethnic background, and socioeconomic status (SES) of the students. METHODS: Nationally representative data were used from over 500 schools and 54,000 students surveyed in 2003, 2004, and 2005 as part of the Youth, Education, and Society (YES) study and the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study. As part of YES, school administrators completed questionnaires on physical activity (including rates of sports and PE participation) of students in their schools. Students in the same schools completed self-administered questionnaires in the same year as part of MTF, providing individual background data, including their gender, racial/ethnic identification, and parents' education level. Data were analyzed in 2006. RESULTS: Physical education requirements, and actual student participation rates, decline substantially between 8th and 12th grades. About 87{\%} of 8th graders were in schools that required them to take PE, compared to only 20{\%} of 12th graders. Principals estimate that over 90{\%} of 8th graders actually take PE, compared to 34{\%} of 12th graders. Subgroup differences in PE participation rates were small. Only a fraction of all students participate in varsity sports during the school year, with girls participating only slightly less than boys (33{\%} vs 37{\%}). Participation correlates negatively with SES and was lower among black and Hispanic students than white students, even after controlling for other variables. Participation rates in intramural sports were even lower, declined in higher grades, and were lower among low-SES and Hispanic students (after controlling for other variables). CONCLUSIONS: Physical education is noticeably lacking in American high schools for all groups. Racial/ethnic minorities and low-SES youth, who are at higher than average risk of being overweight in adolescence, are getting less exercise due to their lower participation in school sports. Disparities in resources available to minorities and lower-SES youth may help explain the differences in participation rates.},

Information regarding professional attitudes, assessment techniques used, problems treated, and treatment procedures utilized was obtained. The questionnaire was mailed to 964 full members of the AABT, and 334 members responded for a 34.6{\%} rate of return. The respondents were divided into two categories based on their primary professional activities (practitioner or academic), and comparisons between these groups were made. The results were also compared to the findings of previous surveys of AABT members (Swan {\&} MacDonald, 1978; Wade, Baker, {\&} Hartman, 1979). The survey results suggested a movement in recent years toward a cognitive behavioral orientation, and identified striking similarities and some differences between practitioners and academics.},

abstract = {Obesity is a major influence on the development and course of cardiovascular diseases and affects physical and social functioning and quality of life. The importance of effective interventions to reduce obesity and related health risks has increased in recent decades because the number of adults and children who are obese has reached epidemic proportions. To prevent the development of overweight and obesity throughout the life course, population-based strategies that improve social and physical environmental contexts for healthful eating and physical activity are essential. Population-based approaches to obesity prevention are complementary to clinical preventive strategies and also to treatment programs for those who are already obese. This American Heart Association scientific statement aims: 1) to raise awareness of the importance of undertaking population-based initiatives specifically geared to the prevention of excess weight gain in adults and children; 2) to describe considerations for undertaking obesity prevention overall and in key risk subgroups; 3) to differentiate environmental and policy approaches to obesity prevention from those used in clinical prevention and obesity treatment; 4) to identify potential targets of environmental and policy change using an ecological model that includes multiple layers of influences on eating and physical activity across multiple societal sectors; and 5) to highlight the spectrum of potentially relevant interventions and the nature of evidence needed to inform population-based approaches. The evidence-based experience for population-wide approaches to obesity prevention is highlighted.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are a promising channel for delivering just-in-time guidance and support for improving key daily health behaviors. Despite an explosion of mobile phone applications aimed at physical activity and other health behaviors, few have been based on theoretically derived constructs and empirical evidence. Eighty adults ages 45 years and older who were insufficiently physically active, engaged in prolonged daily sitting, and were new to smartphone technology, participated in iterative design development and feasibility testing of three daily activity smartphone applications based on motivational frames drawn from behavioral science theory and evidence. An "analytically" framed custom application focused on personalized goal setting, self-monitoring, and active problem solving around barriers to behavior change. A "socially" framed custom application focused on social comparisons, norms, and support. An "affectively" framed custom application focused on operant conditioning principles of reinforcement scheduling and emotional transference to an avatar, whose movements and behaviors reflected the physical activity and sedentary levels of the user. To explore the applications' initial efficacy in changing regular physical activity and leisure-time sitting, behavioral changes were assessed across eight weeks in 68 participants using the CHAMPS physical activity questionnaire and the Australian sedentary behavior questionnaire. User acceptability of and satisfaction with the applications was explored via a post-intervention user survey. The results indicated that the three applications were sufficiently robust to significantly improve regular moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and decrease leisure-time sitting during the 8-week behavioral adoption period. Acceptability of the applications was confirmed in the post-intervention surveys for this sample of midlife and older adults new to smartphone technology. Preliminary data exploring sustained use of the applications across a longer time period yielded promising results. The results support further systematic investigation of the efficacy of the applications for changing these key health-promoting behaviors.},

The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an organizing framework based on principles of learning theory to classify and rank exergames according to embedded behavior change principles. Behavioral contingencies represent a key theory-based game design principle that can be objectively measured, evaluated, and manipulated to help explain and change the frequency and duration of game play. Case examples are presented that demonstrate how to code dimensions of behavior, consequences of behavior, and antecedents of behavior. Our framework may be used to identify game principles which, in the future, might be used to predict which games are most likely to promote adoption and maintenance of leisure time physical activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newly arrived Hispanic immigrants are generally healthier than the U.S.-born population, but this distinction tends to diminish over time as immigrants adapt to a new and different sociocultural environment. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether length of residence in the United States was associated with obesity (body mass index [BMI]>30 kg/m(2)) among Hispanic immigrants. METHODS: Data for 2420 foreign-born Hispanic adults aged > or =18 years were obtained from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity among those with 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and > or =15 years of residence in the United States was 9.4{\%}, 14.5{\%}, 21.0{\%}, and 24.2{\%}, respectively. A logistic regression model adjusted for smoking, physical inactivity, self-assessed health, chronic conditions, functional limitations, nonspecific psychological distress, several sociodemographic characteristics, and access to health services found that longer-term Hispanic immigrants (> or =15 years) experienced a nearly four-fold greater risk of obesity than did recent immigrants (<5 years). CONCLUSIONS: The higher risk for obesity associated with length of residence may be due to acculturation processes such as the adoption of the unhealthy dietary practices (i.e., a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables) and sedentary lifestyles of the host country. The results of this study may facilitate the planning of public health interventions that are directed at subgroups of the Hispanic population.},

abstract = {Rates of overweight in youth have reached epidemic proportions and are associated with adverse health outcomes. Family-based programs have been widely used to treat overweight in youth. However, few programs incorporate a theoretical framework for studying a family systems approach in relation to youth health behavior change. Therefore, this review provides a family systems theory framework for evaluating family-level variables in weight loss, physical activity, and dietary approaches in youth. Studies were reviewed and effect sizes were calculated for interventions that manipulated the family system, including components that targeted parenting styles, parenting skills, or family functioning, or which had novel approaches for including the family. Twenty-one weight loss interventions were identified, and 25 interventions related to physical activity and/or diet were identified. Overall, family-based treatment programs that incorporated training for authoritative parenting styles, parenting skills, or child management, and family functioning had positive effects on youth weight loss. Programs to improve physical activity and dietary behaviors that targeted the family system also demonstrated improvements in youth health behaviors; however, direct effects of parent-targeted programming is not clear. Both treatment and prevention programs would benefit from evaluating family functioning and parenting styles as possible mediators of intervention outcomes. Recommendations are provided to guide the development of future family-based obesity prevention and treatment programs for youth.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine correlates of sedentary behaviors in adolescents through the examination of psychosocial and environmental variables. METHOD: The study used a cross-sectional design to evaluate an ethnically diverse clinic-based sample of 878 adolescents who were 11 to 15 years old. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were stratified by gender to assess correlates of sedentary behaviors occurring on the most recent nonschool day (television viewing, computer video games, sitting listening to music, and talking on the phone). RESULTS: For girls, age, family support, television/video rules, and hills in the neighborhood were associated with sedentary behaviors. Furthermore, psychological constructs such as self-efficacy, enjoyment, change strategies, and pros and cons of change emerged as correlates of sedentary behaviors. A moderator effect revealed that the proportion of girls in the low-BMI group decreased with increased self-efficacy, whereas the proportion of girls in the high-BMI group did not vary significantly by self-efficacy. For boys, age, ethnicity, BMI, cons of change, and self-efficacy were associated with sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of factors associated and not associated with adolescent sedentary behaviors. Similar to physical activity, measures of specific psychosocial constructs of sedentary behavior demonstrated important associations. The results highlight the need for additional examination of the correlates of sedentary behavior to determine which correlates are mechanisms of behavior change.},

Several types of empiric studies have been used to examine possible area or neighborhood effects, including ecologic studies relating area characteristics to morbidity and mortality rates, contextual and multilevel analyses relating area socioeconomic context to health outcomes, and studies comparing small numbers of well-defined neighborhoods. Strengthening inferences regarding the presence and magnitude of neighborhood effects will require addressing a series of conceptual and methodological issues. Many of these issues relate to the need to develop theory and specific hypotheses on the processes through which neighborhood and individual factors may jointly influence specific health outcomes. Important challenges include defining neighborhoods or relevant geographic areas, identifying significant area or neighborhood characteristics, specifying the role of individual-level variables, incorporating life-course and longitudinal dimensions, combining a variety of research designs, and avoiding reductionism in the way in which "neighborhood" factors are incorporated into models of disease causation and quantitative analyses.analyses.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to compare the concurrent accuracy of the CSA accelerometer and the Yamax pedometer under two conditions: 1) on a treadmill at five different speeds and 2) riding in a motorized vehicle on paved roads. METHODS: In study 1, motion sensor performance was evaluated against actual steps taken during 5-min bouts at five different treadmill walking speeds (54, 67, 80, 94, and 107 m.min-1). In study 2, performance was evaluated during a roundtrip (drive 1 and drive 2) motor vehicle travel on paved roads (total distance traveled was 32.6 km or 20.4 miles). Any steps detected during motor vehicle travel were considered error. RESULTS: In study 1, the Yamax pedometer detected significantly (P < 0.05) fewer steps than actually taken at the slowest treadmill speed (54 m.min-1). Further, the pedometer detected fewer steps than the accelerometer at this speed (75.4{\%} vs 98.9{\%}, P < 0.05). There were no differences between instruments compared with actual steps taken at all other walking speeds. In study 2, the CSA detected approximately 17-fold more erroneous steps than the pedometer (approximately 250 vs 15 steps for the total distance traveled, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the error (for either instrument) is not likely an important threat to the assessment of free-living ambulatory populations but may be a problem for pedometers when monitoring frail older adults with slow gaits. On the other hand, CSA accelerometers erroneously detect more nonsteps than the Yamax pedometer under typical motor vehicle traveling conditions. This threat to validity is likely only problematic when using the accelerometer to assess physical activity in sedentary individuals who travel extensively by motor vehicle.},

Each participant wore five wrist-worn consumer monitors [Fitbit Flex (FBF), Jawbone UP 24 (JU24), Misfit Shine (MS), Nike+Fuelband SE (NFS), Polar Loop (PL)] and two research monitors [Actigraph GT3X+ (GT3X+) on the waist, and BodyMedia Core (BMC) on the arm] while being concurrently monitored with the Oxycon Mobile (OM), a portable metabolic system. The energy expenditure (EE) from different activity sessions were measured by OM and estimated by all monitors. RESULTS: Mean absolute percent error (MAPE) values for the full 80-minute protocol ranged from 15.3{\%} (BMC) to 30.4{\%} (MS). The EE estimates from the GT3X+ was found to be equivalent to those from the OM (±10{\%} equivalence zone: 285.1, 348.5). Correlations between OM and the various monitors were generally high (ranges between 0.71 and 0.90). Three monitors had MAPE values less than 20{\%} for sedentary activity: BMC (15.7{\%}), MS (18.2{\%}), and NFS (20.0{\%}). Two monitors had MAPE values less than 20{\%} for aerobic: BMC (17.2{\%}) and NFS (18.5{\%}). None of the monitors had MAPE values less than 25{\%} for resistance exercise. CONCLUSION: Overall, the research monitors and the FBF, JU24, and NFS provided reasonably accurate total EE estimates at the individual level. However, larger error was evident for individual activities, especially resistance exercise. Further research is needed to examine these monitors across various activities and intensities, and under real-world conditions.},

As small electronic devices that track one's activity, sleep, and diet, called self-trackers, are being widely distributed, it is prudent to investigate the user experience and the effectiveness of these devices, and use the information toward engineering better devices that would result in increased efficiency and usability.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to abstract the constructs that constitute the user experiences of the self-tracker for activity, sleep, and diet. Additionally, we aimed to develop and verify the Health Information Technology Acceptance Model-II (HITAM-II) through a qualitative data analysis approach.

METHODS: The study group consisted of 18 female college students who participated in an in-depth interview after completing a 3-month study of utilizing a self-tracker designed to monitor activity, sleep, and diet. The steps followed in the analysis were: (1) extraction of constructs from theoretical frameworks, (2) extraction of constructs from interview data using a qualitative methodology, and (3) abstraction of constructs and modeling of the HITAM-II.

RESULTS: The constructs that constitute the HITAM-II are information technology factors, personal factors, social factors, attitude, behavioral intention, and behavior. These constructs are further divided into subconstructs to additionally support the HITAM-II.

CONCLUSIONS: The HITAM-II was found to successfully describe the health consumer's attitude, behavioral intention, and behavior from another perspective. The result serves as the basis for a unique understanding of the user experiences of HIT.},

A version of the intervention without the reward component was also tested. Participants (n = 386) were from three primary schools, which were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (i) full intervention, where children received "Fit 'n' Fun Dude" peer-modelling materials and were given daily pedometer goals to receive rewards, (ii) no-rewards intervention, where children received peer-modelling materials and pedometer goals but rewards were not used and (iii) control, where children wore pedometers with no further intervention. Physical activity was measured at baseline, intervention and at the end of a 14-week 'taper' phase. During the intervention, the full intervention school showed the largest increase in physical activity relative to baseline (+2456 steps per day, p < 0.001). There was a smaller increase in the no-rewards school (+1033 steps per day, p < 0.03), and no significant change in the control. At the end of the taper phase, physical activity in the no-rewards school continued to increase (+2030 steps per day, p < 0.001) but had returned to baseline in the full intervention school. The intervention that used only peer-modelling and pedometer goals produced better effects over time.},

Risk factors for cardiovascular disease were measured in population-based surveys of Twin Cities metropolitan area residents aged 25-74 years in 1980-1982 and 1985-1987. During this period, age-adjusted, average systolic blood pressure declined nonsignificantly in men and significantly in women, and average, age-adjusted diastolic blood pressure declined 1.1 mmHg in men and 0.9 mmHg in women. Between 1980-1982 and 1985-1987, serum total cholesterol declined significantly, 5.2 and 5.8 mg/dl in men and women, respectively. Serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 1.6 mg/dl in men and 0.9 mg/dl in women. The prevalence of cigarette smoking declined by 14{\%} in men and 18{\%} in women. In contrast, the average body mass index increased 0.6 kg/m2 in men and 1.2 kg/m2 in women. Systematic hospital and death certificate surveillance found that mortality rates for coronary heart disease in the Twin Cities metropolitan area declined 20.1{\%} in men and 12.9{\%} in women from 1981 to 1986. Despite difficulties in interpretation of ecologic studies, it appears likely that improvements in population risk factor levels played a role in the decline in disease rates and could influence future mortality trends in this population.},

@article{Michie2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meeting global health challenges requires effective behaviour change interventions (BCIs). This depends on advancing the science of behaviour change which, in turn, depends on accurate intervention reporting. Current reporting often lacks detail, preventing accurate replication and implementation. Recent developments have specified intervention content into behaviour change techniques (BCTs) - the 'active ingredients', for example goal-setting, self-monitoring of behaviour. BCTs are 'the smallest components compatible with retaining the postulated active ingredients, i.e. the proposed mechanisms of change. They can be used alone or in combination with other BCTs' (Michie S, Johnston M. Theories and techniques of behaviour change: developing a cumulative science of behaviour change. Health Psychol Rev 2012;6:1-6). Domain-specific taxonomies of BCTs have been developed, for example healthy eating and physical activity, smoking cessation and alcohol consumption. We need to build on these to develop an internationally shared language for specifying and developing interventions. This technology can be used for synthesising evidence, implementing effective interventions and testing theory. It has enormous potential added value for science and global health.

OBJECTIVE: (1) To develop a method of specifying content of BCIs in terms of component BCTs; (2) to lay a foundation for a comprehensive methodology applicable to different types of complex interventions; (3) to develop resources to support application of the taxonomy; and (4) to achieve multidisciplinary and international acceptance for future development.

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred participants (systematic reviewers, researchers, practitioners, policy-makers) from 12 countries engaged in investigating, designing and/or delivering BCIs. Development of the taxonomy involved a Delphi procedure, an iterative process of revisions and consultation with 41 international experts; hierarchical structure of the list was developed using inductive 'bottom-up' and theory-driven 'top-down' open-sort procedures (n = 36); training in use of the taxonomy (1-day workshops and distance group tutorials) (n = 161) was evaluated by changes in intercoder reliability and validity (agreement with expert consensus); evaluating the taxonomy for coding interventions was assessed by reliability (intercoder; test-retest) and validity (n = 40 trained coders); and evaluating the taxonomy for writing descriptions was assessed by reliability (intercoder; test-retest) and by experimentally testing its value (n = 190).

RESULTS: Ninety-three distinct, non-overlapping BCTs with clear labels and definitions formed Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 (BCTTv1). BCTs clustered into 16 groupings using a 'bottom-up' open-sort procedure; there was overlap between these and groupings produced by a theory-driven, 'top-down' procedure. Both training methods improved validity (both p < 0.05), doubled the proportion of coders achieving competence and improved confidence in identifying BCTs in workshops (both p < 0.001) but did not improve intercoder reliability. Good intercoder reliability was observed for 80 of the 93 BCTs. Good within-coder agreement was observed after 1 month (p < 0.001). Validity was good for 14 of 15 BCTs in the descriptions. The usefulness of BCTTv1 to report descriptions of observed interventions had mixed results.

CONCLUSIONS: The developed taxonomy (BCTTv1) provides a methodology for identifying content of complex BCIs and a foundation for international cross-disciplinary collaboration for developing more effective interventions to improve health. Further work is needed to examine its usefulness for reporting interventions.

FUNDING: This project was funded by the Medical Research Council Ref: G0901474/1. Funding also came from the Peninsula Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Without standardized definitions of the techniques included in behavior change interventions, it is difficult to faithfully replicate effective interventions and challenging to identify techniques contributing to effectiveness across interventions. This research aimed to develop and test a theory-linked taxonomy of generally applicable behavior change techniques (BCTs). DESIGN: Twenty-six BCTs were defined. Two psychologists used a 5-page coding manual to independently judge the presence or absence of each technique in published intervention descriptions and in intervention manuals. RESULTS: Three systematic reviews yielded 195 published descriptions. Across 78 reliability tests (i.e., 26 techniques applied to 3 reviews), the average kappa per technique was 0.79, with 93{\%} of judgments being agreements. Interventions were found to vary widely in the range and type of techniques used, even when targeting the same behavior among similar participants. The average agreement for intervention manuals was 85{\%}, and a comparison of BCTs identified in 13 manuals and 13 published articles describing the same interventions generated a technique correspondence rate of 74{\%}, with most mismatches (73{\%}) arising from identification of a technique in the manual but not in the article. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing standardized definitions of BCTs included in behavioral interventions and highlight problematic variability in the reporting of intervention content.},

abstract = {The purpose of this systematic review was to catalogue and synthesize published studies that have examined the effects of peer-delivered physical activity interventions on physical activity behavior. Ten published studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The following information was extracted from each study: study design and duration; characteristics of the sample, peers, and interventions; and physical activity outcomes. In all articles reporting within-groups analyses, peer-delivered interventions led to increases in physical activity behavior. When compared to alternatives, peer-delivered interventions were just as effective as professionally delivered interventions and more effective than control conditions for increasing physical activity. Only three studies included measures of social cognitive variables, yielding some evidence that peers may enhance self-efficacy and self-determined forms of motivation. Based on these findings, interventionists are encouraged to include peer mentors in their intervention delivery models. Investigators are encouraged to pursue a more comprehensive understanding of factors that can explain and maximize the impact of peer-delivered activity interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Similar to other fields, a targeted behavioral medicine perspective can aid decision-making related to participant-intervention matching. PURPOSE: To present one potentially useful definition of intervention targeting activity; describe potential targeting domains of particular relevance to behavioral medicine; discuss different statistical approaches to aid the targeted intervention development process; and discuss the challenges and opportunities accompanying the incorporation of targeted intervention development methods into behavioral randomized clinical trial (RCT) research. METHODS: Drawing from recent conceptual work by the MacArthur group and other scientists in the field, methods and approaches to undertaking moderator analysis are discussed. RESULTS: Examples of moderator analyses are provided which reflect the different statistical methods and variable domains that may serve as moderators of intervention success. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended exploratory work can help to make the most efficient use of RCTs to identify the best paths for subsequent RCT development in a resource-constrained era.},

@article{Staudenmayer2009a,
abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to develop and test two artificial neural networks (ANN) to apply to physical activity data collected with a commonly used uniaxial accelerometer. The first ANN model estimated physical activity metabolic equivalents (METs), and the second ANN identified activity type. Subjects (n = 24 men and 24 women, mean age = 35 yr) completed a menu of activities that included sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous intensities, and each activity was performed for 10 min. There were three different activity menus, and 20 participants completed each menu. Oxygen consumption (in ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) was measured continuously, and the average of minutes 4-9 was used to represent the oxygen cost of each activity. To calculate METs, activity oxygen consumption was divided by 3.5 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) (1 MET). Accelerometer data were collected second by second using the Actigraph model 7164. For the analysis, we used the distribution of counts (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of a minute's second-by-second counts) and temporal dynamics of counts (lag, one autocorrelation) as the accelerometer feature inputs to the ANN. To examine model performance, we used the leave-one-out cross-validation technique. The ANN prediction of METs root-mean-squared error was 1.22 METs (confidence interval: 1.14-1.30). For the prediction of activity type, the ANN correctly classified activity type 88.8{\%} of the time (confidence interval: 86.4-91.2{\%}). Activity types were low-level activities, locomotion, vigorous sports, and household activities/other activities. This novel approach of applying ANNs for processing Actigraph accelerometer data is promising and shows that we can successfully estimate activity METs and identify activity type using ANN analytic procedures.},

We systematically reviewed studies related to overweight in children that had included a measure of TV exposure. Literature searches were conducted in MedLINE, PsychInfo, SportDiscus and ISIWeb of Science. Methods of assessing TV viewing were evaluated, including the type of measure, the administration procedure and reported psychometric properties. The majority of studies assessed TV viewing using self-report surveys and very few studies used direct observation. The validity or reliability of measures was often not examined. The majority of tools that were evaluated were compared with another self-report measure or an objective measure of physical activity. TV viewing measures should be selected that are specific to the research question, the study design, as well as methodological feasibility. However, it is recommended that measures of TV viewing be used only if they have psychometric data to support their validity and reliability. Selecting measures that are valid and reliable enables us to examine with greater accuracy the influence of TV viewing on childhood overweight, as well as the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce TV viewing in children.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Active school transport (AST) may be an important source of children's physical activity (PA). Innovative solutions that increase PA time for children, without putting added pressure on the school curriculum, merit consideration. Before implementing such solutions, it is important to demonstrate that active school transport is associated with health-related outcomes. METHODS: Following a standardized protocol, we conducted a systematic review of published research to address this question and explore whether children who actively commute to school also have a healthier body weight. Online searches of 5 electronic databases were conducted. Potential studies were screened on the basis of objective measures of physical activity. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this review. Nine studies demonstrated that children who actively commute to school accumulate significantly more PA and two studies reported that they expended significantly more kilocalories per day. Where studies examined body weight (n=10), only one reported active commuters having a lower body weight. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that active school commuters tend to be more physically active overall than passive commuters. However, evidence for the impact of AST in promoting healthy body weights for children and youth is not compelling.},

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Fitbit program across 7 participants, with and without a behavioral coach, in a multiple-baseline across participants design. Step counts were recorded by a Fitbit accelerometer as a measure of physical activity. The Fitbit program alone increased physical activity for 3 of 7 participants, and the addition of the behavioral coach resulted in further increases in mean step counts for all 6 participants. },

abstract = {Regular physical activity is important for health benefits among youth, but disparities exist. This paper describes disparities in physical activity participation and sedentary behaviors among youth in the United States, provides intervention implications, and offers recommendations for future research focused on reducing disparities related to levels of physical activity. Secondary analysis of national accelerometer data showed that achievement of recommended levels of physical activity ranged across subgroups from 2{\%} to 61{\%}. Mean hours per day spent in sedentary behavior ranged from 5.5 to 8.5. The largest disparities were by gender and age. An improved understanding of correlates may inform the design of interventions to increase physical activity in targeted subgroups. Additional theoretically based research is needed to elucidate which factors contributing to physical activity disparities are amenable to change via intervention. To eliminate health disparities, changes in policies that have an impact on physical activity may be necessary to promote physical activity among high-risk youth.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In 2005, the Texas State Legislature passed Senate Bill 42 (SB42), which required public middle school students (grades 6-8) to participate in 30 minutes of daily structured physical activity. The purpose of this study was to assess awareness of and adherence to SB42 in Texas middle schools, and to assess the impact of SB42 on the frequency and quality of structured physical activity. METHODS: Key informant (school principals, physical education [PE] instructors, nurses, or designated personnel) telephone interviews on the implementation of SB42 were conducted from a statewide representative sample of public middle schools (n=112). Direct observation, key informant, and student report of physical activity in PE classes at 17 Texas-Mexico border middle schools assessed the frequency and quality of structured physical activity. RESULTS: State level (94{\%} +/- 4.5{\%}) and border district (94{\%} +/- 13.5{\%}) key informants reported a high level of overall awareness of SB42. Postimplementation of SB42 border districts reported a minimum of 4 days per week of PE instruction and more than 58 minutes per PE class, exceeding the 30-minute minimum of structured physical activity per day or 135 minutes per week as required by SB42 (range: 58.2-61.4 minutes). A significant increase in the number of days of PE class was observed in the border sample between 2004 and 2005 and 2006 and 2008, with eighth grade students reporting an average of 2.0 days and 3.7 days of PE per week, respectively (p < .001). Additionally, border districts met the Healthy People 2010 objective of 50{\%} time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (mean 54.9{\%} +/- 5.1{\%}) during PE class. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of SB42 appears to have impacted the frequency of school PE in Texas and the prevalence of child self-reported physical activity behaviors along the Texas-Mexico border. General awareness of and adherence to SB42 was high in both statewide and among the border districts. Our mixed findings on adherence to specific components of the legislation suggest the need for further investigation of the factors that both facilitate and inhibit local leadership around school policy and the mechanisms to ensure the school policy is being implemented.},

abstract = {Abstract Biological processes are fundamentally driven by complex interactions between biomolecules. Integrated high-throughput omics studies enable multifaceted views of cells, organisms, or their communities. With the advent of new post-genomics technologies, omics studies are becoming increasingly prevalent; yet the full impact of these studies can only be realized through data harmonization, sharing, meta-analysis, and integrated research. These essential steps require consistent generation, capture, and distribution of metadata. To ensure transparency, facilitate data harmonization, and maximize reproducibility and usability of life sciences studies, we propose a simple common omics metadata checklist. The proposed checklist is built on the rich ontologies and standards already in use by the life sciences community. The checklist will serve as a common denominator to guide experimental design, capture important parameters, and be used as a standard format for stand-alone data publications. The omics metadata checklist and data publications will create efficient linkages between omics data and knowledge-based life sciences innovation and, importantly, allow for appropriate attribution to data generators and infrastructure science builders in the post-genomics era. We ask that the life sciences community test the proposed omics metadata checklist and data publications and provide feedback for their use and improvement.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: In order to understand the prevalence and potential health impact of prolonged workplace sedentary (sitting) time, valid measures are required. Here, we examined the criterion validity of a brief self-report measure of workplace sitting time and breaks in sitting time. METHODS:: An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to assess workplace sitting time (hrs/day) and breaks from sitting per hour at work in a convenience sample of 121 full-time workers (36{\%} men, mean age: 37 years, 53{\%} office based). These self-report measures were compared to accelerometer-derived sedentary time (hrs/day <100 counts/min) and breaks per sedentary hour (number of times counts ≥100/min) during work hours. RESULTS:: Self-reported sitting time was significantly correlated with accelerometer-derived sedentary time (Pearson's r=0.39, 95{\%}CI 0.22, 0.53), with average sitting time 0.45hrs/day higher than average sedentary time. Bland-Altman plots and regression analysis showed positive associations between the difference in sitting and sedentary time, and the average of sitting and sedentary time (mean difference=-2.75 hours + 0.47 x average sitting and sedentary time; limits of agreement +/-2.25hrs/day). The correlation of self-reported breaks per sitting hour with accelerometer-derived breaks per sedentary hour was also statistically significant (Spearman's rs=0.26, 95{\%}CI: 0.11, 0.44). CONCLUSIONS:: This study is the first to examine the criterion validity of an interviewer-administered questionnaire measure of workplace sitting time and breaks in sitting time using objective criterion measures. The workplace sitting measure has acceptable properties for use in observational studies concerned with sedentary behavior in groups of workers; however, the wide limits of agreement suggest caution in estimating individuals' sitting time with high precision. Using self-report measures to capture patterns of workplace sitting (such as breaks in sitting time) requires further development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet has potential as a medium for health behavior change programs, but no controlled studies have yet evaluated the impact of a fully automated physical activity intervention over several months with real-time objective feedback from a monitor. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the impact of a physical activity program based on the Internet and mobile phone technology provided to individuals for 9 weeks. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, stratified controlled trial was conducted from September to December 2005 in Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, with 77 healthy adults whose mean age was 40.4 years (SD = 7.6) and mean body mass index was 26.3 (SD = 3.4). Participants were randomized to a test group that had access to an Internet and mobile phone-based physical activity program (n = 47) or to a control group (n = 30) that received no support. The test group received tailored solutions for perceived barriers, a schedule to plan weekly exercise sessions with mobile phone and email reminders, a message board to share their experiences with others, and feedback on their level of physical activity. Both groups were issued a wrist-worn accelerometer to monitor their level of physical activity; only the test group received real-time feedback via the Internet. The main outcome measures were accelerometer data and self-report of physical activity. RESULTS: At the end of the study period, the test group reported a significantly greater increase over baseline than did the control group for perceived control (P < .001) and intention/expectation to exercise (P < .001). Intent-to-treat analyses of both the accelerometer data (P = .02) and leisure time self-report data (P = .03) found a higher level of moderate physical activity in the test group. The average increase (over the control group) in accelerometer-measured moderate physical activity was 2 h 18 min per week. The test group also lost more percent body fat than the control group (test group: -2.18, SD = 0.59; control group: -0.17, SD = 0.81; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: A fully automated Internet and mobile phone-based motivation and action support system can significantly increase and maintain the level of physical activity in healthy adults.},

abstract = {Advances in mobile computing offer the potential to change when, where, and how health interventions are delivered. Rather than relying on occasional in-clinic interactions, mobile health (mHealth) interventions may overcome constraints due to limited clinician time, poor patient adherence, and inability to provide meaningful interventions at the most appropriate time. Technological capability, however, does not equate with user acceptance and adoption. How then can we ensure that mobile technologies for behavior change meet the needs of their target audience? In this paper, we argue that overcoming acceptance and adoption barriers requires interdisciplinary collaborations, bringing together not only technologists and health researchers but also human-computer interaction (HCI) experts. We discuss the value of human-computer interaction research to the nascent field of mHealth and demonstrate how research from HCI can offer complementary insights on the creation of mobile health interventions. We conclude with a discussion of barriers to interdisciplinary collaborations in mobile health and suggest ways to overcome them.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have shown self-monitoring can modify health behaviors, including physical activity (PA). This study tested the utility of a wearable sensor/device (Fitbit(®) One™; Fitbit Inc., San Francisco, CA) and short message service (SMS) text-messaging prompts to increase PA in overweight and obese adults.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven adults wore a Fitbit One tracker for 6 weeks; half were randomized to also receive three daily SMS-based PA prompts. The Fitbit One consisted of a wearable tracker for instant feedback on performance and a Web site/mobile application (app) for detailed summaries. Outcome measures were objectively measured steps and minutes of PA by intensity using two accelerometers: Actigraph™ (Pensacola, FL) GT3X+ (primary measure) at baseline and Week 6 and Fitbit One (secondary measure) at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

RESULTS: Mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of primary measures indicated a significant within-group increase of +4.3 (standard error [SE]=2.0) min/week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) at 6-week follow-up (p=0.04) in the comparison group (Fitbit only), but no study group differences across PA levels. Secondary measures indicated the SMS text-messaging effect lasted for only 1 week: the intervention group increased by +1,266 steps (SE=491; p=0.01), +17.8 min/week MVPA (SE=8.5; p=0.04), and +38.3 min/week total PA (SE=15.9; p=0.02) compared with no changes in the comparison group, and these between-group differences were significant for steps (p=0.01), fairly/very active minutes (p<0.01), and total active minutes (p=0.02).

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the Fitbit One achieved a small increase in MVPA at follow-up and that the SMS-based PA prompts were insufficient in increasing PA beyond 1 week. Future studies can test this intervention in those requiring less help and/or test strategies to increase participants' engagement levels.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether taking 10,000 steps in a day is equivalent to meeting the current minimum physical activity guidelines of accumulating at least 30 min of moderate physical activity (IMPA). Fifty-nine women ages 20-65 years wore a pedometer and accelerometer concurrently on their right hip for 1 day. There were no differences in the age, body mass index, or the amount of time the pedometers and accelerometers were worn between the 10K+ and the < 10K groups. The 10K+ group accumulated significantly more steps and minutes of MPA than the < 10K group (M = 13,084 steps, SD = 2,603 vs. M = 7,518 steps, SD = 1,956; and M = 62.1 min, SD = 27.7 vs. M = 38.8 min, SD = 18.9; p < .05). A 2 x 2 chi-square analysis demonstrated no difference between the proportions of 10K and < 10K participants who met the step goal, when all minutes of MPA accumulated throughout the day were considered (chi2 = 1.8, df = 1, p = .175). When only continuous bouts of MPA lasting > 5 min and > 10 min were considered, a significantly greater proportion of 10K participants met the current physical activity guidelines than the < 10K participants (chi2 = 11.5, df = 1, p = .001, and chi2 = 5.9, df = 1, p = .015, respectively). Our finding, suggest that individuals who accumulate 10,000 steps/day are more likely to meet the current physical activity guidelines by engaging in the length of bouts promoted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine (Pate et al., 1995) and the US Surgeon General (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996). However, the data also reveal that accumulating 10,000 steps/day does not guarantee meeting the guidelines in the bout lengths documented to confer the health benefits of physical activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine correlates of sedentary behaviors in adolescents through the examination of psychosocial and environmental variables. METHOD: The study used a cross-sectional design to evaluate an ethnically diverse clinic-based sample of 878 adolescents who were 11 to 15 years old. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were stratified by gender to assess correlates of sedentary behaviors occurring on the most recent nonschool day (television viewing, computer video games, sitting listening to music, and talking on the phone). RESULTS: For girls, age, family support, television/video rules, and hills in the neighborhood were associated with sedentary behaviors. Furthermore, psychological constructs such as self-efficacy, enjoyment, change strategies, and pros and cons of change emerged as correlates of sedentary behaviors. A moderator effect revealed that the proportion of girls in the low-BMI group decreased with increased self-efficacy, whereas the proportion of girls in the high-BMI group did not vary significantly by self-efficacy. For boys, age, ethnicity, BMI, cons of change, and self-efficacy were associated with sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of factors associated and not associated with adolescent sedentary behaviors. Similar to physical activity, measures of specific psychosocial constructs of sedentary behavior demonstrated important associations. The results highlight the need for additional examination of the correlates of sedentary behavior to determine which correlates are mechanisms of behavior change.},

Both low sedentary and high exercise activities contribute to increased energy expenditure, improved weight control and prevention of obesity. Exercise, if intensity is at least moderate, has also a positive effect on fat distribution by decreasing the proportion of abdominal or visceral fat. The prevalence of clustered (multiple) cardiovascular risk factors is lower in children and adolescents, who are physically active or fit. However, the risks of obesity are greater than those from being sedentary, i.e., high physical activity reduces, but does not totally offset risks related to obesity. Good health in youth is easily lost by an unhealthy lifestyle in adulthood. An additional benefit of childhood physical activity is that it increases the likelihood of physical activity later in adulthood.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Activity monitoring is used for motivation and assessing patients in the rehabilitation setting. Monitors available on the market have not been assessed for accuracy at walking patterns seen in the clinical setting. 

OBJECTIVES
To assess the accuracy of the Fitbit Zip device at different anatomical locations at walking speeds, step length, and cadence similar to those seen in clinical rehabilitation populations. 

METHODS
Ten healthy participants completed 3 sets of 12 combinations of speed and cadence ranging from 0.2m/s at 48 steps per minute to 1.0 m/s at 120 steps per minute along a 20m walkway. Step length was controlled by ground markings and cadence was controlled by a metronome. Five Fitbit Zip devices were concurrently worn at the chest, hip, shin, ankle and forefoot. Percent accuracy for each location and walking condition combination were calculated. 

RESULTS
At the chest and hip the Fitbit has poor accuracy below 0.7m/s, however when worn distally, can be accurate to 5.5{\%} at speeds as slow as 0.5m/s. 

CONCLUSIONS
For patient populations with slow walking speed, activity monitoring with the Fitbit can be achieved provided the device is located distally on the lower limb.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Current public health campaigns to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes have largely focused on increasing exercise, but have paid little attention to the reduction of sedentary behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between various sedentary behaviors, especially prolonged television (TV) watching, and risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study conducted from 1992 to 1998 among women from 11 states in the Nurses' Health Study. The obesity analysis included 50 277 women who had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 and were free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer and completed questions on physical activity and sedentary behaviors at baseline. The diabetes analysis included 68 497 women who at baseline were free from diagnosed diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: During 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5{\%}) of 50 277 women who had a BMI of less than 30 in 1992 became obese (BMI > or =30). Overall, we documented 1515 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Time spent watching TV was positively associated with risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the multivariate analyses adjusting for age, smoking, exercise levels, dietary factors, and other covariates, each 2-h/d increment in TV watching was associated with a 23{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 17{\%}-30{\%}) increase in obesity and a 14{\%} (95{\%} CI, 5{\%}-23{\%}) increase in risk of diabetes; each 2-h/d increment in sitting at work was associated with a 5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-10{\%}) increase in obesity and a 7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-16{\%}) increase in diabetes. In contrast, standing or walking around at home (2 h/d) was associated with a 9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 6{\%}-12{\%}) reduction in obesity and a 12{\%} (95{\%} CI, 7{\%}-16{\%}) reduction in diabetes. Each 1 hour per day of brisk walking was associated with a 24{\%} (95{\%} CI, 19{\%}-29{\%}) reduction in obesity and a 34{\%} (95{\%} CI, 27{\%}-41{\%}) reduction in diabetes. We estimated that in our cohort, 30{\%} (95{\%} CI, 24{\%}-36{\%}) of new cases of obesity and 43{\%} (95{\%} CI, 32{\%}-52{\%}) of new cases of diabetes could be prevented by adopting a relatively active lifestyle (<10 h/wk of TV watching and > or =30 min/d of brisk walking). CONCLUSIONS: Independent of exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk. This study emphasizes the importance of reducing prolonged TV watching and other sedentary behaviors for preventing obesity and diabetes.},

abstract = {Project HealthDesign, a multi-year, multi-site project sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with additional support from the California HealthCare Foundation, is designed to stimulate innovation in personal health records (PHRs). Project HealthDesign teams employed user-centered design processes to create designs and prototypes of computer-based applications to support and enhance human health for a wide range of patients, from children with chronic health conditions to elders transitioning from hospital to home. A program design philosophy encouraged designers to envision PHRs as a suite of personal health information management tools, or applications, separate from, but drawing upon, personal health data from a variety of sources. In addition to information contained in one's medical record, these personal health data included patient-supplied clinical parameters such as blood glucose and daily weights; as well as patient-generated observations of daily living (ODLs) - the unique, idiosyncratic cues, such as sleep adequacy or confidence in self care, that inform patients about their abilities to manage health challenges and take healthy action. A common technical platform provided infrastructure services such as data standards and identity-management protocols, and helped to demonstrate a scalable, efficient approach to user-centered design of personal health information management systems. The program's ethical, legal and social issues consultancy identified challenges to acceleration of action-focused PHRs: personal control of privacy choices, management of privacy in home conditions, and rebalancing power structures in shared decision making.},

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Population-based US survey, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), merged with US census data describing respondents' neighbourhoods. Participants 13 184 adults from 83 counties and 1805 census tracts who completed NHANES III interviews and medical examinations and whose residential addresses could be reliably geocoded to census tracts. Main outcome measures A summary measure of biological risk, incorporating nine biomarkers that together represent allostatic load across metabolic, cardiovascular and inflammatory subindices. Results Being male, older, having lower income, less education, being Mexican-American and being both black and female were all independently associated with a worse allostatic load. After adjusting for these characteristics, living in a lower NSES was associated with a worse allostatic load (coefficient -0.46; CI -0.079 to -0.012). The relationship between NSES and allostatic load did not vary significantly by gender or race/ethnicity. Conclusions Living in a lower NSES in the USA is associated with significantly greater biological wear and tear as measured by the allostatic load, and this relationship is independent of individual SES characteristics. Our findings show that where one lives is independently associated with allostatic load, thereby suggesting that policies that improve NSES may also yield health returns.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Sedentary behaviors such as TV viewing are associated with childhood obesity, while physical activity promotes healthy weight. The role of the home environment in shaping these behaviors among youth is poorly understood. The study purpose was to examine the reliability of brief parental proxy-report and adolescent self-report measures of electronic equipment and physical activity equipment in the home and to assess the construct validity of these scales by examining their relationship to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight status of children and adolescents. METHODS: Participants were adolescents (n = 189; mean age = 14.6), parents of adolescents (n = 171; mean age = 45.0), and parents of younger children (n = 116; parents mean age = 39.6; children's mean age = 8.3) who completed two surveys approximately one month apart. Measures included a 21-item electronic equipment scale (to assess sedentary behavior facilitators in the home, in the child or adolescent's bedroom, and portable electronics) and a 14-item home physical activity equipment scale. Home environment factors were examined as correlates of children's and adolescents' physical activity, sedentary behavior, and weight status after adjusting for child age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and number of children in the home. RESULTS: Most scales had acceptable test-retest reliability (intraclass correlations were .54 - .92). Parent and adolescent reports were correlated. Electronic equipment in adolescents' bedrooms was positively related to sedentary behavior. Activity equipment in the home was inversely associated with television time in adolescents and children, and positively correlated with adolescents' physical activity. Children's BMI z-score was positively associated with having a television in their bedroom. CONCLUSIONS: The measures of home electronic equipment and activity equipment were similarly reliable when reported by parents and by adolescents. Home environment attributes were related to multiple obesity-related behaviors and to child weight status, supporting the construct validity of these scales.},

Applying SE models to the design of interventions is challenging because models must be tailor-made for each behavior and population, other theories need to be integrated into multi-level frameworks, and empirical research to guide model development is limited. The purpose of the present paper is to describe a SE framework that guided the intervention and measurement plans for a specific study. The trial of activity for adolescent girls (TAAG) is a multi-center study of interventions to reduce the decline of physical activity in adolescent girls. The TAAG framework incorporates operant learning theory, social cognitive theory, organizational change theory and the diffusion of innovation model in a multi-level model. The explicit and practical model developed for TAAG has already benefited the study and may have elements that can generalize to other health promotion studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence on the correlates of objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in childhood is limited. This study aimed to identify correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviour among 7-year-old children in England. METHODS: Physical activity was measured using Actigraph accelerometry in 480 participants as part of the Gateshead Millennium Study during 2006-07. Twenty-two potential correlates across five domains (demographic and biological; psychological, cognitive and emotional; behavioural; social and cultural; physical environmental) were tested for associations with total volume of habitual physical activity, moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behaviour. Multiple linear regression analysis was used. RESULTS: Seven correlates, including four that are potentially modifiable, were significantly associated with total physical activity, MVPA and sedentary behaviour in final models: gender, child weight status, maternal age, child interest in active play, active commuting to school, parenting practice and season. Four of these variables were significantly associated with all three constructs in final models. The final models explained 18, 18 and 24{\%} of variance in total volume of physical activity, MVPA and sedentary behaviour, respectively. CONCLUSION: A number of potentially modifiable factors are associated with increased physical activity and/or reduced sedentary behaviour in English children. These could be valuable targets of future interventions.},

@article{Webb2010b,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet is increasingly used as a medium for the delivery of interventions designed to promote health behavior change. However, reviews of these interventions to date have not systematically identified intervention characteristics and linked these to effectiveness.

OBJECTIVES: The present review sought to capitalize on recently published coding frames for assessing use of theory and behavior change techniques to investigate which characteristics of Internet-based interventions best promote health behavior change. In addition, we wanted to develop a novel coding scheme for assessing mode of delivery in Internet-based interventions and also to link different modes to effect sizes.

METHODS: We conducted a computerized search of the databases indexed by ISI Web of Knowledge (including BIOSIS Previews and Medline) between 2000 and 2008. Studies were included if (1) the primary components of the intervention were delivered via the Internet, (2) participants were randomly assigned to conditions, and (3) a measure of behavior related to health was taken after the intervention.

RESULTS: We found 85 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, providing a total sample size of 43,236 participants. On average, interventions had a statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior (d(+) = 0.16, 95{\%} CI 0.09 to 0.23). More extensive use of theory was associated with increases in effect size (P = .049), and, in particular, interventions based on the theory of planned behavior tended to have substantial effects on behavior (d(+) = 0.36, 95{\%} CI 0.15 to 0.56). Interventions that incorporated more behavior change techniques also tended to have larger effects compared to interventions that incorporated fewer techniques (P < .001). Finally, the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions was enhanced by the use of additional methods of communicating with participants, especially the use of short message service (SMS), or text, messages.

CONCLUSIONS: The review provides a framework for the development of a science of Internet-based interventions, and our findings provide a rationale for investing in more intensive theory-based interventions that incorporate multiple behavior change techniques and modes of delivery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: Sitting at work is an emerging occupational health risk. Few instruments designed for use in population-based research measure occupational sitting and standing as distinct behaviours. This study aimed to develop and validate a brief measure of occupational sitting and physical activity. METHODS:: A convenience sample (N=99, 61{\%} female) was recruited from two medium-sized workplaces and by word-of-mouth in Sydney, Australia. Participants completed the newly developed Occupational Sitting and Physical Activity Questionnaire (OSPAQ) and a modified version of the MONICA Optional Study on Physical Activity Questionnaire (modified MOSPA-Q) twice, one week apart. Participants also wore an Actigraph accelerometer for the seven days in between the test and retest. Analyses determined test-retest reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and assessed criterion validity against accelerometers using Spearman's rho. RESULTS:: The test-retest ICCs for occupational sitting, standing and walking for OSPAQ ranged from 0.73-0.90, while that for the modified MOSPA-Q ranged from 0.54-0.89. Comparison of sitting measures with accelerometers showed higher Spearman correlations for the OSPAQ (r=0.65) than for the modified MOSPA-Q (r=0.52). Criterion validity correlations for occupational standing and walking measures were comparable for both instruments with accelerometers (standing: r=0.49; walking: r=0.27-0.29). CONCLUSION:: The OSPAQ has excellent test-retest reliability and moderate validity for estimating time spent sitting and standing at work and is comparable to existing occupational physical activity measures for assessing time spent walking at work. The OSPAQ brief instrument measures sitting and standing at work as distinct behaviours and would be especially suitable in national health surveys, prospective cohort studies and other studies that are limited by space constraints for questionnaire items.},

abstract = {There is growing global concern over the growing levels of obesity and the fact that people in general are not as active as they once were. Many believe that this is directly related to poor diet and our increasing reliance on technology, such as television, social networking, computer games, and voice activated home control systems. These kinds of activities increase sedentary behaviour across all age groups and is considered one of the main contributors to obesity and poor health. For this reason decreasing sedentary behaviour is considered a crucial theme within many research programs in health. Ironically, there is general agreement that the use of technology is likely to help researchers understand this type of behaviour. One interesting approach is based upon the use of human digital memories to provide visual lifelogs of a users activity and to identify the behaviour patterns of individuals. In this way visual lifelogs provide a way for users to evaluate their lifestyle choices. This paper discusses some of the key technologies used to achieve this and considers some of the challenges that still need to be addressed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze diurnal profiles of physical activity for community-dwelling adults aged 70 years and over, and to explore the moderating effect of sex, age, morbidity, mobility limitation, and season on physical activity throughout the day.

METHODS: A sample of 149 primary health care patients (mean age 79.5 ± 5.2 years, 74.5{\%} females) was included in the analyses. Participants' physical activity was measured on up to six consecutive days via Omron Walking Style Pro HJ-720IT-E2 pedometer. Step count per day and per hour, and pedometer wear time were descriptively analyzed. A repeated measures ANOVA with physical activity per hour as dependent variable was performed to analyze the moderating effect of sex, age, morbidity, mobility limitation, and season on diurnal profiles of physical activity. The diurnal profile for the total sample and adjusted diurnal profiles for subgroups are presented.

RESULTS: Participants' daily step count averaged 3280 ± 1873 steps/day. They wore the pedometer for 14.2 ± 1.7 hours per day and walked on average 234 ± 139 steps per hour. With respect to diurnal profiles, there were two peaks at 10-11 AM (mean [95{\%}-confidence interval]: 382 [329-435] steps) and at 3-4 pm (313 [261-365] steps) interrupted by a period of lower activity with a low point at 1-2 pm (229 [190-268] steps). A mobility limitation, defined by use of a cane or a rollator, had a significant moderating effect (p = 0.0237) on diurnal physical activity.

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to explore pedometer-determined diurnal profiles of physical activity in chronically ill and mobility-limited older adults. Prolonging periods of elevated physical activity in the afternoon while respecting individual daily routine and commitments could be one option for facilitating the integration of physical activity and for making it a habit in older adults' daily lives. The use of a walking aid seems to be an indicator for a quite low activity plateau during the second half of the day. People who use walking aids should be motivated to increase their physical activity during afternoon; this might help to increase the overall low physical activity level of this vulnerable subgroup of older adults.},

(1) The over burdened health care system will face a worldwide wave of retirees who will live longer, cost more to treat, and demand new goods and services to help them stay healthy, active, and independent. Research in persuasive technologies and the associated usage of a computing system, device, or application intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior in a predetermined way is showing the potential to assist in improving healthy living, reduce the costs on the health care system, and allow the aged to maintain a more independent life. This article gives a deeper insight into the evolution of persuasive technologies and presents a framework that can guide a researcher or practitioner in comprehending more effectively the work being done in this novel research field. It also provides categories of domains within health care in which these technologies are used and surveys exemplars from published literature. The article's goal is to provide greater understanding by addressing the challenges that lie ahead for all key stakeholders that design and/or use persuasive technologies in health care.},

abstract = {Childhood obesity continues to be a significant public health issue. mHealth systems offer state-of-the-art approaches to intervention design, delivery, and diffusion of treatment and prevention efforts. Benefits include cost effectiveness, potential for real-time data collection, feedback capability, minimized participant burden, relevance to multiple types of populations, and increased dissemination capability. However, these advantages are coupled with unique challenges. This commentary discusses challenges with using mHealth strategies for child obesity prevention, such as lack of scientific evidence base describing effectiveness of commercially available applications; relatively slower speed of technology development in academic research settings as compared with industry; data security, and patient privacy; potentially adverse consequences of increased sedentary screen time, and decreased focused attention due to technology use. Implications for researchers include development of more nuanced measures of screen time and other technology-related activities, and partnering with industry for developing healthier technologies. Implications for health practitioners include monitoring, assessing, and providing feedback to child obesity program designers about users' data transfer issues, perceived security and privacy, sedentary behavior, focused attention, and maintenance of behavior change. Implications for policy makers include regulation of claims and quality of apps (especially those aimed at children), supporting standardized data encryption and secure open architecture, and resources for research-industry partnerships that improve the look and feel of technology. Partnerships between academia and industry may promote solutions, as discussed in this commentary.},

abstract = {Older people are more sedentary than other age groups. We sought to determine if providing an accelerometer with feedback about activity and counseling older subjects using Go4Life educational material would increase activity levels. Participants were recruited from independent living areas within assisted living facilities and the general public in the Rochester, MN area. 49 persons aged 65-95 (79.5±7.0 years) who were ambulatory but sedentary and overweight participated in this randomized controlled crossover trial for one year. After a baseline period of 2 weeks, group 1 received an accelerometer and counseling using Go4Life educational material (www.Go4Life.nia.nih.gov) for 24 weeks and accelerometer alone for the next 24 weeks. Group 2 had no intervention for the first 24 weeks and then received an accelerometer and Go4Life based counseling for 24 weeks. There were no significant baseline differences between the two groups. The intervention was not associated with a significant change in activity, body weight, {\%} body fat, or blood parameters (p>0.05). Older (80-93) subjects were less active than younger (65-79) subjects (p=0.003). Over the course of the 48 week study, an increase in activity level was associated with a decline in {\%} body fat (p=0.008). Increasing activity levels benefits older patients. However, providing an accelerometer and a Go4Life based exercise counseling program did not result in a 15{\%} improvement in activity levels in this elderly population. Alternate approaches to exercise counseling may be needed in elderly people of this age range.},

abstract = {We re-examine the pace of rising obesity among Hispanic immigrants and the effects associated with longer duration in the US, or what is referred to as unhealthy assimilation, the convergence of immigrant health to a less healthy native-born standard. Consistent with previous research, we find that across all race-ethnic groups, immigrants tend to be less obese than native-born persons. Second, obesity is clearly on the rise, with obesity rates increasing for both immigrant and native-born populations between 1995 and 2005. However, our findings are that immigrant obesity rises more slowly than for native-born Hispanics in the same age cohort. The significance is that immigrants do not converge to obesity prevalence of the native-born as commonly assumed and, in fact, the differential is wider in 2005 than it was in 1995. The analysis, which is based on the National Health Interview Survey tracks the obesity rates of different cohort populations observed in repeated cross-sections (1995 and 2005), as both immigrants and the native-born grow older and additionally, as immigrants reside in the U.S. longer. More specifically, for immigrants, our study distinguishes the effects of length of U.S. residence (observed at a single point in time) and increasing duration of residence (observed over time). Of crucial importance, we contrast the changes over time for native and foreign-born residents passing through the same age range from 1995 to 2005. Misconclusions of previous research stem from 1) assuming that any change for immigrants equates to assimilation, without regard to native-born change, and 2) an unbalanced analysis that fails to track in parallel the growing obesity of both immigrant and native-born cohorts.},

We describe an analytic framework to identify and distinguish between moderators and mediators in RCTs when outcomes are measured dimensionally.

Participants were 484 men and women aged 40-69 years from Montgomery County, Maryland. Nine percent of men and 7{\%} of women were defined as underreporters of both energy and protein intake on 24HRs; for FFQs, the comparable values were 35{\%} for men and 23{\%} for women. On average, men underreported energy intake compared with total energy expenditure by 12-14{\%} on 24HRs and 31-36{\%} on FFQs and underreported protein intake compared with a protein biomarker by 11-12{\%} on 24HRs and 30-34{\%} on FFQs. Women underreported energy intake on 24HRs by 16-20{\%} and on FFQs by 34-38{\%} and underreported protein intake by 11-15{\%} on 24HRs and 27-32{\%} on FFQs. There was little underreporting of the percentage of energy from protein for men or women. These findings have important implications for nutritional epidemiology and dietary surveillance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) is widely used to assess risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Cut points for the classification of obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) have been developed and validated among people of European descent. It is unknown whether these cut points are appropriate for non-European populations. We assessed the metabolic risk associated with BMI among South Asians, Chinese, Aboriginals, and Europeans. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly sampled 1078 subjects from 4 ethnic groups (289 South Asians, 281 Chinese, 207 Aboriginals, and 301 Europeans) from 4 regions in Canada. Principal components factor analysis was used to derive underlying latent or "hidden" factors associated with 14 clinical and biochemical cardiometabolic markers. Ethnic-specific BMI cut points were derived for 3 cardiometabolic factors. Three primary latent factors emerged that accounted for 56{\%} of the variation in markers of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and blood pressure. For a given BMI, elevated levels of glucose- and lipid-related factors were more likely to be present in South Asians, Chinese, and Aboriginals compared with Europeans, and elevated levels of the blood pressure-related factor were more likely to be present among Chinese compared with Europeans. The cut point to define obesity, as defined by distribution of glucose and lipid factors, is lower by approximately 6 kg/m2 among non-European groups compared with Europeans. CONCLUSIONS: Revisions may be warranted for BMI cut points to define obesity among South Asians, Chinese, and Aboriginals. Using these revised cut points would greatly increase the estimated burden of obesity-related metabolic disorders among non-European populations.},

abstract = {The field of behavioral science has produced myriad data on health behavior change strategies and leveraged such data into effective human-delivered interventions to improve health. Unfortunately, the impact of traditional health behavior change interventions has been heavily constrained by patient and provider burden, limited ability to measure and intervene upon behavior in real time, variable adherence, low rates of implementation, and poor third-party coverage. Digital health technologies, including mobile phones, sensors, and online social networks, by being available in real time, are being explored as tools to increase our understanding of health behavior and to enhance the impact of behavioral interventions. The recent explosion of industry attention to the development of novel health technologies is exciting but has far outpaced research. This Special Section of Translational Behavioral Medicine, Smartphones, Sensors, and Social Networks: A New Age of Health Behavior Change features a collection of studies that leverage health technologies to measure, change, and/or understand health behavior. We propose five key areas in which behavioral science can improve the impact of digital health technologies on public health. First, research is needed to identify which health technologies actually impact behavior and health outcomes. Second, we need to understand how online social networks can be leveraged to impact health behavior on a large scale. Third, a team science approach is needed in the developmental process of health technologies. Fourth, behavioral scientists should identify how a balance can be struck between the fast pace of innovation and the much slower pace of research. Fifth, behavioral scientists have an integral role in informing the development of health technologies and facilitating the movement of health technologies into the healthcare system.},

PURPOSE:                       This study examined the association of four non-occupational sedentary behaviours, individually and in total, with mental well-being in employed adults.                                         METHODS:                       Baseline data from the evaluation of Well@Work, a national workplace health promotion project conducted in the UK, were used. Participants self-reported sitting time whilst watching television, using a computer, socialising and travelling by motorised transport.

abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the association of body fatness and sedentary status with asthma and respiratory symptoms in schoolchildren in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. A questionnaire study elicited episodes of respiratory symptoms and data on lifestyle and anthropometric parameters in 1329 5th grade schoolchildren. Results showed that 12.4{\%} of boys and 9.5{\%} of girls had physician-diagnosed asthma, whereas 15.1{\%} of boys and 12.4{\%} of girls had suspected asthma. Significantly greater proportions of boys had non-exercise-induced respiratory symptoms than girls (p < 0.05). The number of respiratory symptoms was positively correlated with TV-watching time per day and self-reported sedentary time per weekend-day in girls (p < 0.05). Underweight was positively associated with one of the seven respiratory symptoms in girls (p < 0.05). At risk of overweight was positively associated with two of the seven respiratory symptoms in boys and one of the seven respiratory symptoms in girls (all p < 0.05). The risk of having physician-diagnosed asthma and suspected asthma increased 93{\%} and 72{\%}, respectively, in schoolchildren at risk of overweight (p < 0.05). Overweight was associated with a 78{\%} increase in physician-diagnosed asthma (adjusted odd ratio (aOR) = 1.78, 95{\%} CI = 1.08-2.91, p < 0.05). Higher sedentary time was significantly associated with more occurrences of one of the seven respiratory symptoms in girls (aOR = 1.05, 95{\%} CI = 1.00-1.11, p < 0.05). Higher body mass index (BMI) was significantly correlated with longer TV-watching time per day in girls and longer self-reported sedentary time per weekday in boys (p < 0.05). In summary, schoolchildren who are at risk of overweight or overweight and/or have more sedentary time have increased risk of respiratory symptoms and asthma. Weight and sedentary statuses of schoolchildren can affect their respiratory health.},

We were able to classify studies into one of two primary approaches for defining place and corresponding geographic areas of influence: those based on contextual effects derived from shared pre-determined administrative units and those based on individually unique geographic buffers. The 22 contextual papers evaluated 80 relations, 38 of which did not achieve statistical significance. The 15 buffer papers evaluated 40 relations, 24 of which did not achieve statistical significance. There was very little between-study similarity in methods in both types of approaches, which prevented estimation of pooled effects. The great heterogeneity across studies limits what can be learned from this body of evidence.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article was to review international (excluding the United States) school-based interventions for preventing obesity in children published between 1999 and 2005. A total of 21 such interventions were found from Australia (1), Austria (1), Canada (1), Chile (1), France (1), Germany (3), Greece (1), New Zealand (1), Norway (1), Singapore (1) and the United Kingdom (9). The grade range of these interventions was from pre-school to high school with the majority (17) from elementary schools. Nine of these interventions targeted nutrition behaviours followed by seven aiming to modify both physical activity and nutrition behaviours. Only five interventions in international settings were based on any explicit behavioural theory which is different than the interventions developed in the United States. Majority of the interventions (9) were one academic year long. It can be speculated that if the interventions are behavioural theory-based, then the intervention length can be shortened. All interventions that documented parental involvement successfully influenced obesity indices. Most interventions (16) focused on individual-level behaviour change approaches. Most published interventions (16) used experimental designs with at least 1-year follow-up. Recommendations from international settings for enhancing the effectiveness of school-based childhood obesity interventions are presented.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Alternative high school (AHS) students are an underserved population of youth at greater risk for poor health behaviors and outcomes. Little is known about their physical activity patterns. PURPOSE:: The purpose of this study was to describe 1) physical activity levels of students attending alternative high schools (AHS) in St. Paul/Minneapolis, MN, and 2) compliance with wearing a physical activity accelerometer. METHODS: Sixty-five students (59{\%} male, 65{\%} <18 yr old, 51{\%} African American, 17{\%} Caucasian, 32{\%} mixed and other) wore an accelerometer during all waking hours for 7 d as part of the baseline assessment for a school-based physical activity and dietary behavior intervention. Accelerometer data were reduced to summary variables using a custom software program. Compliance with wearing the accelerometer was assessed by the number of days with >or=10 h of data. Accelerometer counts per minute and minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were calculated. RESULTS: Students averaged 323 +/- 143.0 counts min(-1) and 51 +/- 25.5 min d(-1) of MVPA. Minutes of MVPA d(-1) were greater on weekdays compared with the weekend (52 +/- 27.3 vs 43 +/- 39.7 min d(-1), respectively; P = 0.05). However, students wore the accelerometer less on the weekends (weekdays = 17.2 +/- 3.0, weekend = 14.9 +/- 6.8 h d(-1)). Expressing minutes of MVPA as a percentage of the number of minutes of available data, students spent approximately 5{\%} of their time in MVPA on weekdays and weekends. Forty-five percent of students had 7 d of data, 51{\%} had 4-6 d, and 5{\%} had fewer than 4 d. On average, students wore the accelerometer for 17 +/- 3.2 h d(-1) (range = 12.0-23.8 h d(-1)). CONCLUSION: Compliance was high (95{\%} of students provided at least 4 d of data), and physical activity was relatively low representing a vulnerable population in need of further study and intervention.},

METHODS: A total of 3993 Black and White men and women aged 18 to 30 years were examined at baseline, and 2, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years later. Blood pressure and physical activity were measured at each exam. Hypertension was defined as systolic 140 mm Hg or higher, diastolic 90 mm Hg or higher, or antihypertensive medication use. Average physical activity and incident hypertension over 15 years of follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 634 cases of incident hypertension over 15 years of follow-up. Those who were more versus less physically active experienced a reduced risk (hazard rate ratio = 0.83; 95{\%} confidence interval = 0.73, 0.93) for incident hypertension, after adjustment for race, sex, age, education, and family history of high blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity merits attention in the prevention of incident hypertension among young adults, particularly as they move into middle age.},

BITs offer promising opportunities to expand psychological practice. However, to realize the potential of BITs, psychologists must understand both the possibilities and the limitations associated with using technology to advance psychology. We review examples of the most cutting-edge BITs and discuss features that differentiate BITs from traditional modes of delivery. We highlight major challenges in designing BITs, including adherence, engagement, technological and interventional obsolescence, multidisciplinary collaboration, and a reliance on psychological skeuomorphisms. Psychologists who do not understand the conceptual and applied considerations involved in creating BITs risk being left out of the development of BITs in the future. Teaming psychologists with experts in technology will help to promote novel interventions rather than using technology to disseminate existing treatments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newly arrived Hispanic immigrants are generally healthier than the U.S.-born population, but this distinction tends to diminish over time as immigrants adapt to a new and different sociocultural environment. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether length of residence in the United States was associated with obesity (body mass index [BMI]>30 kg/m(2)) among Hispanic immigrants. METHODS: Data for 2420 foreign-born Hispanic adults aged > or =18 years were obtained from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity among those with 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and > or =15 years of residence in the United States was 9.4{\%}, 14.5{\%}, 21.0{\%}, and 24.2{\%}, respectively. A logistic regression model adjusted for smoking, physical inactivity, self-assessed health, chronic conditions, functional limitations, nonspecific psychological distress, several sociodemographic characteristics, and access to health services found that longer-term Hispanic immigrants (> or =15 years) experienced a nearly four-fold greater risk of obesity than did recent immigrants (<5 years). CONCLUSIONS: The higher risk for obesity associated with length of residence may be due to acculturation processes such as the adoption of the unhealthy dietary practices (i.e., a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables) and sedentary lifestyles of the host country. The results of this study may facilitate the planning of public health interventions that are directed at subgroups of the Hispanic population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interventions delivered through new device technology, including mobile phone apps, appear to be an effective method to reach young adults. Previous research indicates that self-efficacy and social support for physical activity and self-regulation behavior change techniques (BCT), such as goal setting, feedback, and self-monitoring, are important for promoting physical activity; however, little is known about evaluations by the target population of BCTs applied to physical activity apps and whether these preferences are associated with individual personality characteristics.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore young adults' opinions regarding BCTs (including self-regulation techniques) applied in mobile phone physical activity apps, and to examine associations between personality characteristics and ratings of BCTs applied in physical activity apps.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among healthy 18 to 30-year-old adults (N=179). Data on participants' gender, age, height, weight, current education level, living situation, mobile phone use, personality traits, exercise self-efficacy, exercise self-identity, total physical activity level, and whether participants met Dutch physical activity guidelines were collected. Items for rating BCTs applied in physical activity apps were selected from a hierarchical taxonomy for BCTs, and were clustered into three BCT categories according to factor analysis: "goal setting and goal reviewing," "feedback and self-monitoring," and "social support and social comparison."

RESULTS: Most participants were female (n=146), highly educated (n=169), physically active, and had high levels of self-efficacy. In general, we observed high ratings of BCTs aimed to increase "goal setting and goal reviewing" and "feedback and self-monitoring," but not for BCTs addressing "social support and social comparison." Only 3 (out of 16 tested) significant associations between personality characteristics and BCTs were observed: "agreeableness" was related to more positive ratings of BCTs addressing "goal setting and goal reviewing" (OR 1.61, 95{\%} CI 1.06-2.41), "neuroticism" was related to BCTs addressing "feedback and self-monitoring" (OR 0.76, 95{\%} CI 0.58-1.00), and "exercise self-efficacy" was related to a high rating of BCTs addressing "feedback and self-monitoring" (OR 1.06, 95{\%} CI 1.02-1.11). No associations were observed between personality characteristics (ie, personality, exercise self-efficacy, exercise self-identity) and participants' ratings of BCTs addressing "social support and social comparison."

CONCLUSIONS: Young Dutch physically active adults rate self-regulation techniques as most positive and techniques addressing social support as less positive among mobile phone apps that aim to promote physical activity. Such ratings of BCTs differ according to personality traits and exercise self-efficacy. Future research should focus on which behavior change techniques in app-based interventions are most effective to increase physical activity.},

abstract = {Several meta-analyses examining the effects of exercise on depression have been criticized for including studies of poor methodological integrity. More recent meta-analyses addressed the most common criticism by including only randomized control trials; however, these analyses suffer from incomplete literature searches and lack of moderating variable analyses. Using a more extensive search procedure, the current meta-analysis examines the effects of exercise on depressive symptoms in 58 randomized trials (n = 2982). An overall effect size of -0.80 indicates participants in the exercise treatment had significantly lower depression scores than those receiving the control treatment. This frac34; SD advantage represents level 1, Grade A evidence for the effects of exercise upon depression. Analysis of moderating variables examined the influence of population characteristics, exercise characteristics and methodological characteristics. Examination of clinical significance in 16 trials with clinically depressed patients found 9 of 16 exercise treatment groups were classified as 'recovered' at post-treatment, with another three groups classified as 'improved'. Analysis showed dropout rates for the exercise treatment were similar to those found in psychotherapeutic and drug interventions.},

abstract = {The effect of psychosocial stress on health has been a central focus area of public health research. However, progress has been limited due a to lack of wearable sensors that can provide robust measures of stress in the field. In this paper, we present a wireless sensor suite called AutoSense that collects and processes cardiovascular, respiratory, and thermoregularity measurements that can inform about the general stress state of test subjects in their natural environ- ment. AutoSense overcomes several challenges in the de- sign of wearable sensor systems for use in the field. First, it is unobtrusively wearable because it integrates six sen- sors in a small form factor. Second, it demonstrates a low power design; with a lifetime exceeding ten days while con- tinuously sampling and transmitting sensor measurements. Third, sensor measurements are robust to several sources of errors and confounds inherent in field usage. Fourth, it inte- grates an ANT radio for low power and integrated quality of service guarantees, even in crowded environments. The Au- toSense suite is complemented with a software framework on a smart phone that processes sensor measurements received from AutoSense to infer stress and other rich human behav- iors. AutoSense was used in a 20+ subject real-life scientific study on stress in both the lab and field, which resulted in the first model of stress that provides 90{\%} accuracy. Categories},

abstract = {Both national and international bodies recommend an increased intake of fruits and vegetables in order to decrease the risk of overweight and obesity. However, there is a rationale to investigate the separate role of fruits. The aim of this paper was to systematically review and analyse published human intervention, prospective observational and cross-sectional studies on fruit intake and body weight in adults. We identified three intervention, eight prospective observational and five cross-sectional studies that explored this relationship. Two of the intervention studies showed that fruit intake reduced body weight, five of the prospective observational studies showed that fruit consumption reduced the risk of developing overweight and obesity, and four of the cross-sectional studies found an inverse association between fruit intake and body weight. Important methodological differences and limitations in the studies make it difficult to compare results. However, the majority of the evidence points towards a possible inverse association between fruit intake and overweight. Future intervention and prospective observational studies examining the direct and independent role of fruit in body-weight management in free-living individuals are needed. Moreover, important determinants such as energy density, energy content, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical form of fruit and preparation methods need to be included in future studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between screen time (ST) (ie, television/DVD/video and computer use) guidelines and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver diseases in mid-adolescence. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: High schools in Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Grade 10 students (N = 496; 58{\%} boys; mean [SD] age, 15.4 [0.4] years). MAIN EXPOSURES: Body mass index, waist circumference, cardiorespiratory endurance, dietary factors, socioeconomic status, and pubertal status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screen time was categorized as less than 2 hours per day or 2 or more hours per day and calculated for weekday, weekend, and the entire week. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for levels of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and glucose; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); levels of alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; and blood pressure. Abnormal results were categorized according to published guidelines. RESULTS: Mean ST for all students was 3.1 hours per day and for weekdays and weekend days, 2.6 hours per day and 4.4 hours per day, respectively. Boys were more likely to exceed ST guidelines than girls (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.67-4.38). There were no significant associations between ST guidelines and metabolic risk factors among girls. After adjusting for potential confounders, boys who exceeded ST guidelines on weekdays were more likely to have elevated HOMA-IR (adjusted OR, 2.42; 95{\%} CI, 1.11-5.28) and insulin levels (adjusted OR, 2.73; 95{\%} CI, 1.43-5.23). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent boys with ST of 2 or more hours per day on weekdays have twice the risk of abnormal levels of insulin and HOMA-IR compared with peers with ST less than 2 hours per day on weekdays. These results suggest there is an increased risk of insulin resistance among adolescent boys who do not meet ST guidelines on weekdays.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Given the decline in physical activity (PA) levels among youth populations it is vital to understand the factors that are associated with PA in order to inform the development of new prevention programs. Many studies have examined individual characteristics associated with PA among youth yet few have studied the relationship between the school environment and PA despite knowing that there is variability in student PA levels across schools. METHODS: Using multi-level logistic regression analyses we explored the school- and student-level characteristics associated with PA using data from 2,379 grade 5 to 8 students attending 30 elementary schools in Ontario, Canada as part of the PLAY-Ontario study. RESULTS: Findings indicate that there was significant between-school random variation for being moderately and highly active; school-level differences accounted for 4.8{\%} of the variability in the odds of being moderately active and 7.3{\%} of the variability in the odds of being highly active. Students were more likely to be moderately active if they attended a school that used PA as a reward and not as discipline, and students were more likely to be highly active if they attended a school with established community partnerships. Important student characteristics included screen time sedentary behaviour, participating in team sports, and having active friends. CONCLUSION: Future research should evaluate if the optimal population level impact for school-based PA promotion programming might be achieved most economically if intervention selectively targeted the schools that are putting students at the greatest risk for inactivity.},

@article{Bandura1977,
abstract = {Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sedentary behavior is emerging as an independent risk factor for physical health, although there is no existing evidence regarding mental well-being. PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the association between recreational sedentary behavior (based on TV- and screen-based entertainment [TVSE] time) and mental health in a representative sample of adults. METHODS: Participants were 3920 men and women (mean age 51.0+/-15.8 years) from the 2003 Scottish Health Survey. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the mental health component of the 12-Item Short-Form Survey Instrument (MCS-12) were administered to obtain information on current mental health. Self-reported TVSE time, physical activity, and physical function was also measured. Analyses were conducted in 2009. RESULTS: Approximately 25{\%} of participants engaged in at least 4 hours/day of TVSE. In general linear models, TVSE time per week was independently associated with GHQ-12 score (higher scores represent worse mental health status) after adjustment for age, gender, physical activity, physical function, area deprivation level, smoking, alcohol, fruit and vegetable intake, and BMI. After full adjustment, participants in the group with the highest TVSE level (>4 hours/day) had an increase in GHQ-12 score of 0.28 (95{\%} CI=0.05, 0.51) compared with participants in the group with the lowest TVSE level (< or =2 hours/day). In stratified analyses, the association between TVSE time and GHQ-12 score persisted across all physical activity levels. Similar associations were observed using the MCS-12. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behavior in leisure time is independently associated with poorer mental health scores in a representative population sample.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To explore the views high school students have about various physical activity contexts and their ideas of potential physical activity promoting strategies. METHODS: Forty-four students from New Zealand high schools with a low decile rating participated in one of nine focus groups. All groups were separated by gender and ethnicity (Maori, New Zealand European). A standardized semi-structured schedule that included key questions and prompts was used. Thematic induction of the raw data was conducted using the long table approach. RESULTS: Perceived benefits of physical activity participation centered on fun, achievement, and physical-related factors. Key barriers to physical activity engagement included lack of peer social support and low accessibility to, and availability of, physical activity opportunities. The structure of physical education (PE) classes was a barrier noted by females. Distance was consistently articulated as a barrier to commuting actively to school. Reflective of the barriers raised by participants, self-identified strategies to promote physical activity participation included environmental modifications such as (1) increasing social support from peers, (2) improving availability of, and accessibility to, activities at school and in their neighborhood, (3) providing organized activities at school, and (4) restructuring physical education classes. CONCLUSION: In line with the current understandings of barriers to physical activity participation, youth perceptions were focused toward environmental factors, both social and physical, thereby supporting further development of environment-focused interventions. The potential of the peer, school, neighborhood, and home strategies reported in our study need to be considered in future initiatives targeting youth physical activity.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Observational studies have shown a positive association between time outdoors and physical activity in children. Time outdoors may be a feasible intervention target to increase the physical activity of youth, but methods are required to accurately measure time spent outdoors in a range of locations and over a sustained period. The Global Positioning System (GPS) provides precise location data and can be used to identify when an individual is outdoors. The aim of this study was to investigate whether GPS data recorded outdoors were associated with objectively measured physical activity. METHODS: Participants were 1010 children (11.0 +/- 0.4 years) recruited from 23 urban primary schools in South West England, measured between September 2006 and July 2008. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry (Actigraph GT1M) and children wore a GPS receiver (Garmin Foretrex 201) after school on four weekdays to record time outdoors. Accelerometer and GPS data were recorded at 10 second epochs and were combined to describe patterns of physical activity when both a GPS and accelerometer record were present (outdoors) and when there was accelerometer data only (indoors). ANOVA was used to investigate gender and seasonal differences in the patterns of outdoor and indoor physical activity, and linear regression was used to examine the cross-sectional associations between GPS-measured time outdoors and physical activity. RESULTS: GPS-measured time outdoors was a significant independent predictor of children's physical activity after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Physical activity was more than 2.5 fold higher outdoors than indoors (1345.8 +/- 907.3 vs 508.9 +/- 282.9 counts per minute; F = 783.2, p < .001). Overall, children recorded 41.7 +/- 46.1 minutes outdoors between 3.30 pm and 8.30 pm, with more time spent outdoors in the summer months (p < .001). There was no gender difference in time spent outdoors. Physical activity outdoors was higher in the summer than the winter (p < .001), whilst there was no seasonal variation in physical activity indoors. CONCLUSIONS: Duration of GPS recording is positively associated with objectively measured physical activity and is sensitive to seasonal differences. Minute by minute patterning of GPS and physical activity data is feasible and may be a useful tool to investigate environmental influences on children's physical activity and to identify opportunities for intervention.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Little has been published about racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of overweight among adolescents that accounts in detail for socioeconomic status, acculturation, and behavioral and environmental factors. Increased understanding of factors associated with overweight can provide a rational basis for developing interventions to address the obesity epidemic in the United States. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional analysis of data from adolescents who participated in the California Health Interview Survey 2003, we estimated the prevalence of overweight and at risk of overweight, combined as a single measure (AROW, body mass index > or =85th percentile). We used logistic regression models to examine associations between AROW and risk factors. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of California adolescents were AROW. The prevalence of AROW differed significantly by sex and race. Boys were more likely than girls to be AROW (33{\%} vs 25{\%}). American Indians/Pacific Islanders/others (39{\%}) were at highest risk, followed by Hispanics (37{\%}), blacks (35{\%}), whites (23{\%}), and Asians (15{\%}). For boys, older age, Hispanic or American Indian/Pacific Islander/other race/ethnicity, lower education of parents, and longer residence in the United States were significantly associated with AROW. For girls, Hispanic or black race/ethnicity, lower education of parents, and poor dietary habits were significantly associated with AROW. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of AROW among California adolescents in most racial/ethnic groups indicates the need for culturally specific and appropriate interventions to prevent and treat overweight.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of reducing television viewing and computer use on children's body mass index (BMI) as a risk factor for the development of overweight in young children. DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: University children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy children aged 4 to 7 years whose BMI was at or above the 75th BMI percentile for age and sex. INTERVENTIONS: Children were randomized to an intervention to reduce their television viewing and computer use by 50{\%} vs a monitoring control group that did not reduce television viewing or computer use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age- and sex-standardized BMI (zBMI), television viewing, energy intake, and physical activity were monitored every 6 months during 2 years. RESULTS: Children randomized to the intervention group showed greater reductions in targeted sedentary behavior (P < .001), zBMI (P < .05), and energy intake (P < .05) compared with the monitoring control group. Socioeconomic status moderated zBMI change (P = .01), with the experimental intervention working better among families of low socioeconomic status. Changes in targeted sedentary behavior mediated changes in zBMI (P < .05). The change in television viewing was related to the change in energy intake (P < .001) but not to the change in physical activity (P =.37). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing television viewing and computer use may have an important role in preventing obesity and in lowering BMI in young children, and these changes may be related more to changes in energy intake than to changes in physical activity.},

abstract = {Mobile devices can be used to deliver psychosocial interventions, yet there is little prior application in severe mental illness. We provide the rationale, design, and preliminary data from 3 ongoing clinical trials of mobile interventions developed for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Project 1 used a personal digital assistant to prompt engagement in personalized self-management behaviors based on real-time data. Project 2 employed experience sampling through text messages to facilitate case management. Project 3 was built on group functional skills training for schizophrenia by incorporating between-session mobile phone contacts with therapists. Preliminary findings were of minimal participant attrition, and no broken devices; yet, several operational and technical barriers needed to be addressed. Adherence was similar to that reported in nonpsychiatric populations, with high participant satisfaction. Therefore, mobile devices seem feasible and acceptable in augmenting psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness, with future research in establishing efficacy, cost effectiveness, and ethical and safety protocols.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVEV: This study examined whether multivariate profiles of the neighborhood recreation environment were associated with adolescent physical activity, sedentary time, and obesity. DESIGN: Residential addresses of 871 adolescents in San Diego County (53{\%} female, mean age = 12.8 years) were geocoded to create 1-mile network buffers. MEASURES: Geographic information systems calculated neighborhood environmental variables. Accelerometers (worn 3-7 days) estimated daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time. Height and weight were directly measured. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis, using 7 environmental variables, resulted in 3 neighborhood profiles characterized as "open space" (OS), "residential with cul-de-sacs" (RWC), and "housing {\&} facility dense" (HFD). These were named Adolescent Recreation Environment Accessibility (AREA) profiles. Multiple regression models stratified by gender tested associations between the AREA profiles and outcomes. Boys were less sedentary in the OS and RWC neighborhoods (7 hours per day) compared with the HFD neighborhoods (8 hours per day) (P < .01), and boys were more likely to be obese in the HFD neighborhoods (55{\%}) compared with the OS group (24{\%}) (P < .05). Girls in the RWC neighborhoods had lower MVPA levels (70 minutes per day) and were more likely to be obese (31{\%}) than those in the OS neighborhoods (79 minutes per day MVPA, 21{\%} obese) (Ps < .05). No differences were found for boys' MVPA or girls' sedentary time by the AREA profiles. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the complex relationships among environmental factors, activity levels, and obesity.nn.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Laboratory studies of adult walking behavior have consistently found that a cadence of 100 steps/min is a reasonable threshold for moderate intensity. The purpose of this study was to determine cadence patterns in free-living adults, and in particular, time spent at increasing cadence increments including 100 steps/min and beyond.

METHOD: 3744 adults ≥20 years provided at least one valid day (minimally 10/24 h of wear) of minute-by-minute accelerometer-determined step data during the 2005-2006 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Means for time spent (min/day) and steps/day were calculated for 8 cadence categories including zero and each incremental cadence band thereafter beginning with 1-19 through 100-119, and beyond to 120+steps/min.

RESULTS: U.S. adults accumulate ≅4.8 h/day of zero cadence during wearing time, ≅8.7 h between 1 and 59 steps/min, ≅16 min/day at cadences of 60-79 steps/min, ≅8 min at 80-99 steps/min, ≅5 min at 100-119 steps/min, and ≅2 min at 120+steps/min.

CONCLUSION: Self-selected walking at 100+steps/min was a rare phenomenon in this large free-living sample of the U.S. population, but study participants did accumulate ≅30 min/day at cadences of 60+steps/min.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Few studies have explored how relationships of perceived environment and physical activity vary across different activity domains and populations. This question was explored in five physical activity intervention trials funded by the National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium. DESIGN: Observational. SETTINGS: San Francisco peninsula, California (N = 94); Eugene, Oregon (N = 122); Atlanta, Georgia (N = 256); Kingston, Rhode Island (N = 109); Memphis, Tennessee (N = 64). SUBJECTS: Ethnically diverse community adults ages 18 to 85 years. MEASURES: The Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale and CHAMPS physical activity questionnaire. Response rate among those invited to complete these measures was 90{\%}. RESULTS: Cross-sectional pooled signal detection analysis indicated that people who reported living in neighborhoods with more attractive scenery and ease of walking were more likely to meet national physical activity recommendations (67{\%}) compared with those without these neighborhood attributes (36{\%}; chi2 = 13.04, p = .0003). Within-site multiple regression identified two additional variables--seeing others when walking and encountering loose dogs that make it difficult to walk--as correlates across multiple sites and activity domains (i.e., minutes of weekly moderate or more vigorous activity, walking for errands, walking leisurely) (incremental R2 = 2.0-7.5; p < .05). Analyses of covariance suggested that traffic safety might be particularly important in facilitating or impeding physical activity in response to a formal intervention (for traffic-arm assignment interactions, F = 3.8-7.0, p < or = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Relationships between perceived environments and physical activity may differ depending upon population groups and activity domains and merit investigation by using stronger prospective designs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Television viewing time, the predominant leisure-time sedentary behavior, is associated with biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, but its relationship with mortality has not been studied. We examined the associations of prolonged television viewing time with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and non-CVD/noncancer mortality in Australian adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: Television viewing time in relation to subsequent all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality (median follow-up, 6.6 years) was examined among 8800 adults > or =25 years of age in the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). During 58 087 person-years of follow-up, there were 284 deaths (87 CVD deaths, 125 cancer deaths). After adjustment for age, sex, waist circumference, and exercise, the hazard ratios for each 1-hour increment in television viewing time per day were 1.11 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.20) for all-cause mortality, 1.18 (95{\%} CI, 1.03 to 1.35) for CVD mortality, and 1.09 (95{\%} CI, 0.96 to 1.23) for cancer mortality. Compared with a television viewing time of <2 h/d, the fully adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.13 (95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 1.36) for > or =2 to <4 h/d and 1.46 (95{\%} CI, 1.04 to 2.05) for > or =4 h/d. For CVD mortality, corresponding hazard ratios were 1.19 (95{\%} CI, 0.72 to 1.99) and 1.80 (95{\%} CI, 1.00 to 3.25). The associations with both cancer mortality and non-CVD/noncancer mortality were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Television viewing time was associated with increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. In addition to the promotion of exercise, chronic disease prevention strategies could focus on reducing sitting time, particularly prolonged television viewing.},

abstract = {Accelerometers are often used to quantify the acceleration of the body in arbitrary units (counts) to measure physical activity (PA) and to estimate energy expenditure. The present study investigated whether the identification of types of PA with one accelerometer could improve the estimation of energy expenditure compared with activity counts. Total energy expenditure (TEE) of 15 subjects was measured with the use of double-labeled water. The physical activity level (PAL) was derived by dividing TEE by sleeping metabolic rate. Simultaneously, PA was measured with one accelerometer. Accelerometer output was processed to calculate activity counts per day (AC(D)) and to determine the daily duration of six types of common activities identified with a classification tree model. A daily metabolic value (MET(D)) was calculated as mean of the MET compendium value of each activity type weighed by the daily duration. TEE was predicted by AC(D) and body weight and by AC(D) and fat-free mass, with a standard error of estimate (SEE) of 1.47 MJ/day, and 1.2 MJ/day, respectively. The replacement in these models of AC(D) with MET(D) increased the explained variation in TEE by 9{\%}, decreasing SEE by 0.14 MJ/day and 0.18 MJ/day, respectively. The correlation between PAL and MET(D) (R(2) = 51{\%}) was higher than that between PAL and AC(D) (R(2) = 46{\%}). We conclude that identification of activity types combined with MET intensity values improves the assessment of energy expenditure compared with activity counts. Future studies could develop models to objectively assess activity type and intensity to further increase accuracy of the energy expenditure estimation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between screen time (ST) (ie, television/DVD/video and computer use) guidelines and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and fatty liver diseases in mid-adolescence. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: High schools in Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Grade 10 students (N = 496; 58{\%} boys; mean [SD] age, 15.4 [0.4] years). MAIN EXPOSURES: Body mass index, waist circumference, cardiorespiratory endurance, dietary factors, socioeconomic status, and pubertal status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screen time was categorized as less than 2 hours per day or 2 or more hours per day and calculated for weekday, weekend, and the entire week. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for levels of high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, and glucose; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); levels of alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; and blood pressure. Abnormal results were categorized according to published guidelines. RESULTS: Mean ST for all students was 3.1 hours per day and for weekdays and weekend days, 2.6 hours per day and 4.4 hours per day, respectively. Boys were more likely to exceed ST guidelines than girls (odds ratio [OR], 2.71; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.67-4.38). There were no significant associations between ST guidelines and metabolic risk factors among girls. After adjusting for potential confounders, boys who exceeded ST guidelines on weekdays were more likely to have elevated HOMA-IR (adjusted OR, 2.42; 95{\%} CI, 1.11-5.28) and insulin levels (adjusted OR, 2.73; 95{\%} CI, 1.43-5.23). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent boys with ST of 2 or more hours per day on weekdays have twice the risk of abnormal levels of insulin and HOMA-IR compared with peers with ST less than 2 hours per day on weekdays. These results suggest there is an increased risk of insulin resistance among adolescent boys who do not meet ST guidelines on weekdays.},

abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that physical inactivity is an important determinant of numerous chronic diseases. However, self-reported estimates of physical activity contain measurement errors responsible for attenuating relative risk estimates. A validation study conducted in 2002-2003 at the Alberta Cancer Board (Canada) included a physical activity questionnaire, four 7-day physical activity logs, and four sets of accelerometer data from 154 study subjects (51{\%} women) aged 35-65 years. The authors used a measurement error model to evaluate validity of the different types of physical activity assessment, and the attenuation factors, after taking into account error correlations between self-reported measurements. The validity coefficients, which express the correlation between measured and true exposure, were higher for accelerometers (0.81, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.76, 0.85) compared with the physical activity log (0.57, 95{\%} CI: 0.47, 0.66) and questionnaire measurements (0.26, 95{\%} CI: 0.12, 0.40). The estimate of the attenuation factor for questionnaires was 0.13 (95{\%} CI: 0.05, 0.23). Accuracy of physical activity questionnaire measurements was higher for men than for women, for younger individuals, and for those with a lower body mass index. Because the degree of attenuation in relative risk estimates is substantial, after the role of error correlations was considered, validation studies quantifying the impact of measurement errors on physical activity estimates are essential to evaluate the impact of physical inactivity on health.},

abstract = {The What's Working project described the initial impact of the United States' federally mandated Local Wellness Policy in rural, low-income elementary schools located in Colorado. Before and after the Local Wellness Policy mandate went into effect, a survey about school features related to nutrition and physical activity was sent to a random sample of 45 rural elementary schools (i.e., schools located outside of urban areas), in which at least 40{\%} of students qualified for free or reduced-cost lunch. Overall, opportunities for physical activity did not change after the policy went into effect: although time in physical education increased by 14 min per week (P=0.10), time for recess decreased by roughly 19 min per week (P=0.10). Policies supporting student participation in physical education and recess (an unstructured time during school hours when students are allowed to play outside) did not change. The researchers coded Local Wellness Policies and found them to have weak wording that produced minimal impact. Content analysis of key informant interviews suggested several barriers to the impact of the Local Wellness Policies: (1) competing pressures facing school districts, (2) lack of resources devoted to the Local Wellness Policy, (3) principals' lack of knowledge about the policy, and (4) lack of accountability mechanisms to ensure policy implementation. Financial resources and more effective communication about Local Wellness Policies among school districts and principals are needed to elevate the importance of and increase opportunities for physical activity in rural, low-income Colorado elementary schools.},

abstract = {The use of smart phones has increased dramatically and there are nearly a billion users on 3G and 4G networks worldwide. Nearly 60{\%} of the U.S. population uses smart phones to access the internet, and smart phone sales now surpass those of desktop and laptop computers. The speed of wireless communication technology on 3G and 4G networks and the widespread adoption and use of iOS equipped smart phones (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) provide infrastructure for the transmission of wireless biomedical data, including ECG data. These technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity for physicians to continually access data that can be used to detect issues before symptoms occur or to have definitive data when symptoms are present. The technology also greatly empowers and enables the possibility for unprecedented patient participation in their own medical education and health status as well as that of their social network. As patient advocates, physicians and particularly cardiac electrophysiologists should embrace the future and promise of wireless ECG recording, a technology solution that can truly scale across the global population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Advances in technology, social influences and environmental attributes have resulted in substantial portions of the day spent in sedentary pursuits.  Sedentary behavior may be a cause of many chronic diseases including obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Research demonstrated that breaking up sedentary time was beneficially associated with markers of body composition, cardiovascular health and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify the total energy expenditure of three different durations of physical activity within a 30-minute sedentary period and to examine the potential benefits of interrupting sedentary behavior with physical activity for weight control.        METHODS:Participants completed four consecutive 30-minute bouts of sedentary behavior (reading, working on the computer, or doing other desk activities) with and without interruptions of walking at a self-selected pace.  Bout one contained no walking interruptions.  Bout two contained a 1-minute walking period. Bout three contained a 2-minute walking period. Bout four contained a 5-minute walking period.  Body composition and resting metabolic rate were assessed.  
 Result
  Twenty males and females (18-39 years) completed this study.  Results of the repeated measures analysis of variance with post-hoc testing showed that significantly more energy was expended during each 30 minute sedentary bout with a walking break than in the 30 minute sedentary bout (p<0.05 for all comparisons).  On average, participants expended an additional 3.0, 7.4, and 16.5 additional net or activity kilocalories during bouts 2, 3, and 4, respectively compared with bout 1.  When extrapolated for a full eight-hour working day, this data shows that an individual would theoretically expend an additional 24, 59 or 132 kilocalories per day, if they stood up and walked at a normal, self selected pace for one, two or five minutes every hour, respectively, compared with sitting for the 8-hour period.  CONCLUSIONS:This study demonstrated that making small changes, such as taking a five minute walking break every hour could yield beneficial weight control or weight loss results.  Therefore, taking breaks from sedentary time is a potential outlet to prevent obesity and the rise of obesity in developed countries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effectiveness of two interventions on children's physical activity during the 20-min school break. METHODS: Children from three schools participated in this study. In the first intervention school (n=89) the school's courts were allocated to different children on alternate days of the week, playground markings were painted in the school's yard and jump ropes were provided. In the second intervention school (n=89) the school's courts were just allocated to different children on alternate days of the week. The third school served as the control group (n=69). Physical activity was measured with a pedometer during the 20-min break (09:05-09:25) and during the after school period (13:05 till bed time). Data were collected in Cyprus, between January/April of 2007. RESULTS: A significant time by group interaction indicated a change in break-time activity. Four weeks after the intervention, mean steps in the first (1427+/-499) and second (1331+/-651) intervention schools were significantly higher than steps in the control school (1053+/-447). Non-significant increases were observed in the after-school activity of children in the intervention schools. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing simple, low-cost interventions during break periods could help increase children's activity.},

abstract = {Wearable, portable, and implantable medical sensors have ushered in a new paradigm for healthcare in which patients can take greater responsibility and caregivers can make well-informed, timely decisions. Health-monitoring systems built on such sensors have huge potential benefit to the quality of healthcare and quality of life for many people, such as patients with chronic medical conditions (such as blood-sugar sensors for diabetics), people seeking to change unhealthy behavior (such as losing weight or quitting smoking), or athletes wishing to monitor their condition and performance. To be effective, however, these systems must provide assurances about the quality of the sensor data. The sensors must be applied to the patient by a human, and the sensor data may be transported across multiple networks and devices before it is presented to the medical team. While no system can guarantee data quality, we anticipate that it will help for the system to annotate data with some measure of confidence. In this paper, we take a deeper look at potential health-monitoring usage scenarios and highlight research challenges required to ensure and assess quality of sensor data in health-monitoring systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for more carefully developed public health measures in order to curb the obesity epidemic among youth. The overall aim of the "EuropeaN Energy balance Research to prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth" (ENERGY)-project is the development and formative evaluation of a theory-informed and evidence-based multi-component school-based and family-involved intervention program ready to be implemented and evaluated for effectiveness across Europe. This program aims at promoting the adoption or continuation of health behaviors that contribute to a healthy energy balance among school-aged children. Earlier studies have indicated that school and family environments are key determinants of energy-balance behaviors in schoolchildren. Schools are an important setting for health promotion in this age group, but school-based interventions mostly fail to target and involve the family environment. METHODS: Led by a multidisciplinary team of researchers from eleven European countries and supported by a team of Australian experts, the ENERGY-project is informed by the Environmental Research Framework for Weight gain Prevention, and comprises a comprehensive epidemiological analysis including 1) systematic reviews of the literature, 2) secondary analyses of existing data, 3) focus group research, and 4) a cross European school-based survey. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The theoretical framework and the epidemiological analysis will subsequently inform stepwise intervention development targeting the most relevant energy balance-related behaviors and their personal, family-environmental and school-environmental determinants applying the Intervention Mapping protocol. The intervention scheme will undergo formative and pilot evaluation in five countries. The results of ENERGY will be disseminated among key stakeholders including researchers, policy makers and the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The ENERGY-project is an international, multidisciplinary effort to develop and test an evidence-based and theory-informed intervention program for obesity prevention among school-aged children.},

abstract = {Fueled by the rapid pace of discovery, humankind's ability to understand the ultimate causes of preventable common disease burdens and to identify solutions is now reaching a revolutionary tipping point. Achieving optimal health and well-being for all members of society lies as much in the understanding of the factors identified by the behavioral, social, and public health sciences as by the biological ones. Accumulating advances in mathematical modeling, informatics, imaging, sensor technology, and communication tools have stimulated several converging trends in science: an emerging understanding of epigenomic regulation; dramatic successes in achieving population health-behavior changes; and improved scientific rigor in behavioral, social, and economic sciences. Fostering stronger interdisciplinary partnerships to bring together the behavioral-social-ecologic models of multilevel "causes of the causes" and the molecular, cellular, and, ultimately, physiological bases of health and disease will facilitate breakthroughs to improve the public's health. The strategic vision of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is rooted in a collaborative approach to addressing the complex and multidimensional issues that challenge the public's health. This paper describes OBSSR's four key programmatic directions (next-generation basic science, interdisciplinary research, systems science, and a problem-based focus for population impact) to illustrate how interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary perspectives can foster the vertical integration of research among biological, behavioral, social, and population levels of analysis over the lifespan and across generations. Interdisciplinary and multilevel approaches are critical both to the OBSSR's mission of integrating behavioral and social sciences more fully into the NIH scientific enterprise and to the overall NIH mission of utilizing science in the pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There are a vast number of smartphone applications (apps) aimed at promoting medication adherence on the market; however, the theory and evidence base in terms of applying established health behavior change techniques underpinning these apps remains unclear. This study aimed to code these apps using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy (v1) for the presence or absence of established behavior change techniques.

METHODS: The sample of apps was identified through systematic searches in both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store in February 2015. All apps that fell into the search categories were downloaded for analysis. The downloaded apps were screened with exclusion criteria, and suitable apps were reviewed and coded for behavior change techniques in March 2015. Two researchers performed coding independently.

RESULTS: In total, 166 medication adherence apps were identified and coded. The number of behavior change techniques contained in an app ranged from zero to seven (mean=2.77). A total of 12 of a possible 96 behavior change techniques were found to be present across apps. The most commonly included behavior change techniques were "action planning" and "prompt/cues," which were included in 96{\%} of apps, followed by "self-monitoring" (37{\%}) and "feedback on behavior" (36{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS: The current extent to which established behavior change techniques are used in medication adherence apps is limited. The development of medication adherence apps may not have benefited from advances in the theory and practice of health behavior change.},

abstract = {Injuries resulting from falls are a significant public health issue, particularly for older people. This review provides an update of the evidence on the effects of various physical activity (PA) or exercise intervention strategies for the prevention of unintentional falls among older people. Six systematic reviews, and three randomised controlled trials not incorporated in previous reviews, were located with a literature search. There is clear evidence that a targeted supervised home exercise program of strength and balance exercise and walking practice, prescribed by a trained health professional, can prevent falls among older community dwellers. There is also an indication that untargeted group exercise (ie, not individually prescribed) can prevent falls among community dwellers, particularly if it involves Tai Chi or other exercises which challenge balance. There is some indication that individual prescription of PA is more important in frailer groups. Further investigation is required to establish the effects of PA in residential aged care, and the relative effects of different types of PA in different populations. In addition, multidisciplinary, multifactorial. health/environmental risk factor screening/intervention programs have been found to be effective in preventing falls. For many individuals with physical risk factors for falls (eg, impaired strength, balance or functional ability), PA alone is likely to reduce the risk of falls. For those with additional risk factors (eg, visual impairments, psychoactive medication use), other interventions may also be required.},

Studies (n = 24) where workers self-monitored productivity or safety behaviors were reviewed and scored along dimensions relevant to research and practice. For intervention conditions (n = 38), standardized effect sizes ranged from 0.2 to 14.5 (weighted average d = 2.8). The results encourage the use of BSM in workplace interventions, but the literature has insufficiently addressed the isolated and additive effects of BSM, worker involvement and individual differences, assessment applications, and theory testing and development.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess the accuracy of a Polar heart rate monitor in measuring heart rate in exercising cardiac rehabilitation patients. Design: Simultaneous heart rate recordings comparing results from the Polar monitor with those from Holter monitoring and intermittent pulse rate as measured by radial artery palpation. Setting: Exercise sessions in a community-based cardiac rehabilitation centre. Patients: Twenty phase III cardiac rehabilitation patients recovering from an acute cardiac event. Main outcome measures: Comparison of heart rates recorded by the two systems and by pulse rate measurement. Results: The Polar monitor gave results very similar to those from Holter monitoring. Intermittent pulse rate measurement gave a limited and less accurate view of the intensity of the exercise session. Conclusion: The Polar heart rate monitor gives accurate readings during cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions at low cost. It is a useful tool which allows assessment of exercise intensity which is not available from intermittent radial pulse rate measurement.},

A search for observational studies was carried out using several electronic databases from June 2004-June 2008. Of 1 255 potentially eligible papers, 47 papers were included, which described 48 studies. Most studies (41/48; 85{\%}) were cross-sectional and 31/48 (65{\%}) used proxies for adiposity, such as body mass index (BMI) or BMI z-score as the outcome measure. Few studies (10{\%}; 5/48) focused on pre-school children. There was consistent evidence of negative associations between objectively measured physical activity and adiposity: significant negative associations were observed in 38/48 (79{\%}) of studies overall. The present review supports the hypothesis that higher levels of habitual physical activity are protective against child and adolescent obesity. However, prospective longitudinal studies are warranted; there is a need for more research on younger children, and for more 'dose-response' evidence.},

This approach is illustrated with an example from the Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research, which resulted in 91 requirements. These requirements were analyzed against the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protected versus non-protected health information. The requirements addressed all FIPPs, showing how a DRN's technical infrastructure is able to fulfill HIPAA regulations, protect privacy, and provide a trustworthy platform for research.},

abstract = {Objective: Meta-analyses of behavior change (BC) interventions typically find large heterogeneity in effectiveness and small effects. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of active BC interventions designed to promote physical activity and healthy eating and investigate whether theoretically specified BC techniques improve outcome. Design: Interventions, evaluated in experimental or quasi-experimental studies, using behavioral and/or cognitive techniques to increase physical activity and healthy eating in adults, were systematically reviewed. Intervention content was reliably classified into 26 BC techniques and the effects of individual techniques, and of a theoretically derived combination of self-regulation techniques, were assessed using meta-regression. Main Outcome Measures: Valid outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating. Results: The 122 evaluations (N = 44,747) produced an overall pooled effect size of 0.31 (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.26 to 0.36, I2 = 69{\%}). The technique, “self-monitoring,” explained the greatest amount of among-study heterogeneity (13{\%}). Interventions that combined self-monitoring with at least one other technique derived from control theory were significantly more effective than the other interventions (0.42 vs. 0.26). Conclusion: Classifying interventions according to component techniques and theoretically derived technique combinations and conducting meta-regression enabled identification of effective components of interventions designed to increase physical activity and healthy eating.},

The first is a technological problem, and specifically, a lack of maturity in technologies for the collection, processing, and data visualization. This is accompanied by a perhaps more fundamental problem of deficit, bias, and lack of integration of aspects concerning the human side of the QS idea. The step that the authors tried to make in this chapter is to highlight aspects that could lead to a more robust approach in QS area. This was done, primarily, through a new approach in data visualization and, secondly, through a necessary management of complexity, both in technological terms and, for what concerns the human side of the whole issue, in theoretical terms. The authors have gone a little further stressing how the future directions of research could lead to significant impacts on both individual and social level.},

Rats in the exercise groups had free access to a running wheel for 2 weeks and then all rats received nonreinforced presentations of a visual stimulus (light) during the 1st training session, followed by daily sessions in which the light was paired with food. Nonexercising male and female SHR rats exhibited more unconditioned orienting behavior than Wistar-Kyoto rats. SHRs also exhibited impaired conditioning when the light was paired with food. Exercise reduced orienting in female SHRs but not in male SHRs. In the social interaction task, nonexercising male and female SHRs interacted more with an unfamiliar rat than Wistar-Kyoto rats. Exercise reduced the number of social interactions in female SHRs but not male SHRs. There were no differences in general locomotor activity observed between the nonexercising and exercising SHRs. These data indicate that exercise may preferentially benefit female SHRs, and has implications for using exercise as an intervention for ADHD and for understanding sex differences in the effects of exercise on behavior.},

By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93{\%} potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis.},

abstract = {Many programs to increase physical activity have been evaluated in developed countries, where 'leisure time physical activity' is the most frequent domain for interventions. In developing countries, and also with reference to global obesity prevention, different kinds of interventions targeting 'total physical activity' are needed. This requires efforts across agencies and sectors, and in the domains of work, active transport, reduced sitting time, as well as leisure time physical activity promotion. In considering possible solutions, this commentary examined the use of complex systems, where integrated efforts across sectors and agencies might, in combination, contribute to increasing total physical activity. The key sets of actions required globally to increase physical activity were, in our opinion, [i] efforts to disseminate individual-level behavior change programs to reach much larger populations rather than volunteers, [ii] social marketing and mass communication campaigns to change social norms in the community and among professionals and policymakers, [iii] efforts to influence the social and physical environment to make them more conducive to physical activity, and [iv] the development and implementation of national physical activity plans and strategies, with sufficient timelines and resources to achieve measurable change.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the factors that influence physical activity can aid the design of more effective interventions. Previous reviews of correlates of youth physical activity have produced conflicting results. METHODS: A comprehensive review of correlates of physical activity was conducted, and semiquantitative results were summarized separately for children (ages 3-12) and adolescents (ages 13-18). The 108 studies evaluated 40 variables for children and 48 variables for adolescents. RESULTS: About 60{\%} of all reported associations with physical activity were statistically significant. Variables that were consistently associated with children's physical activity were sex (male), parental overweight status, physical activity preferences, intention to be active, perceived barriers (inverse), previous physical activity, healthy diet, program/facility access, and time spent outdoors. Variables that were consistently associated with adolescents' physical activity were sex (male), ethnicity (white), age (inverse), perceived activity competence, intentions, depression (inverse), previous physical activity, community sports, sensation seeking, sedentary after school and on weekends (inverse), parent support, support from others, sibling physical activity, direct help from parents, and opportunities to exercise. CONCLUSION: These consistently related variables should be confirmed in prospective studies, and interventions to improve the modifiable variables should be developed and evaluated.},

abstract = {We are in the midst of what some have called a "mobile health revolution". Medical applications ("apps") for mobile phones are proliferating in the marketplace and clinicians are likely encountering patients with questions about the medical value of these apps. We conducted a review of medical apps focused on endocrine disease. We found a higher percentage of relevant apps in our searches of the iPhone app store compared with the Android marketplace. For our diabetes search in the iPhone store, the majority of apps (33{\%}) focused on health tracking (blood sugars, insulin doses, carbohydrates), requiring manual entry of health data. Only two apps directly inputted blood sugars from glucometers attached to the mobile phone. The remainder of diabetes apps were teaching/training apps (22{\%}), food reference databases (8{\%}), social blogs/forums (5{\%}), and physician directed apps (8{\%}). We found a number of insulin dose calculator apps which technically meet criteria for being a medically regulated mobile application, but did not find evidence for FDA-approval despite their availability to consumers. Far fewer apps were focused on other endocrine disease and included medical reference for the field of endocrinology, access to endocrine journals, height predictors, medication trackers, and fertility apps. Although mobile health apps have great potential for improving chronic disease care, they face a number of challenges including lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness, lack of integration with the health care delivery system, the need for formal evaluation and review and organized searching for health apps, and potential threats to safety and privacy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In May 2013, the iTunes and Google Play stores contained 23,490 and 17,756 smartphone applications (apps) categorized as Health and Fitness, respectively. The quality of these apps, in terms of applying established health behavior change techniques, remains unclear.

METHODS: The study sample was identified through systematic searches in iTunes and Google Play. Search terms were based on Boolean logic and included AND combinations for physical activity, healthy lifestyle, exercise, fitness, coach, assistant, motivation, and support. Sixty-four apps were downloaded, reviewed, and rated based on the taxonomy of behavior change techniques used in the interventions. Mean and ranges were calculated for the number of observed behavior change techniques. Using nonparametric tests, we compared the number of techniques observed in free and paid apps and in iTunes and Google Play.

RESULTS: On average, the reviewed apps included 5 behavior change techniques (range 2-8). Techniques such as self-monitoring, providing feedback on performance, and goal-setting were used most frequently, whereas some techniques such as motivational interviewing, stress management, relapse prevention, self-talk, role models, and prompted barrier identification were not. No differences in the number of behavior change techniques between free and paid apps, or between the app stores were found.

CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that apps promoting physical activity applied an average of 5 out of 23 possible behavior change techniques. This number was not different for paid and free apps or between app stores. The most frequently used behavior change techniques in apps were similar to those most frequently used in other types of physical activity promotion interventions.},

However, inconclusive and conflicting results on predictors of health care disparities remain. We examined the theoretical assumptions and methodological limitations of acculturation research in understanding Latino health care disparities, the evidence for socioeconomic position as a predictor of health care disparities, and the effectiveness of cultural competency practice. Persistent use of culture-driven acculturation models decenters social determinants of health as key factors in health disparities and diminishes the effectiveness of cultural competency practice. Social and economic determinants are more important predictors than is culture in understanding health care disparities. Improvements in the material conditions of low-income Latinos can effectively reduce health care disparities.},

@article{Troped2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies of the built environment and physical activity have implicitly assumed that a substantial amount of activity occurs near home, but in fact the location is unknown. PURPOSE: This study aims to examine associations between built environment variables within home and work buffers and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) occurring within these locations. METHODS: Adults (n=148) from Massachusetts wore an accelerometer and GPS unit for up to 4 days. Levels of MVPA were quantified within 50-m and 1-km home and work buffers. Multiple regression models were used to examine associations between five objective built environment variables within 1-km home and work buffers (intersection density, land use mix, population and housing unit density, vegetation index) and MVPA within those areas. RESULTS: The mean daily minutes of MVPA accumulated in all locations=61.1+/-32.8, whereas duration within the 1-km home buffers=14.0+/-16.4 minutes. Intersection density, land use mix, and population and housing unit density within 1-km home buffers were positively associated with MVPA in the buffer, whereas a vegetation index showed an inverse relationship (all p<0.05). None of these variables showed associations with total MVPA. Within 1 km of work, only population and housing unit density were significantly associated with MVPA within the buffer. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with studies showing that certain attributes of the built environment around homes are positively related to physical activity, but in this case only when the outcome was location-based. Simultaneous accelerometer-GPS monitoring shows promise as a method to improve understanding of how the built environment influences physical activity behaviors by allowing activity to be quantified in a range of physical contexts and thereby provide a more explicit link between physical activity outcomes and built environment exposures.},

abstract = {Physical fitness performance is an important health correlate yet is often unrelated to sedentary behaviour in early adolescence. In this study, we examined the association of sedentary behaviour (i.e. screen time) with weight-related health markers and blood pressure, after controlling for cardiorespiratory fitness performance. American middle school students (N = 153, 56{\%} females) aged 11-15 years (mean 12.6 years, s = 0.5) completed assessments of cardiorespiratory fitness performance, screen time, weight status (BMI percentile, waist-to-height ratio), and blood pressure. Multivariate analysis of covariance, controlling for cardiorespiratory fitness performance, found those who met the daily recommendation of 2 h or less of screen time (n = 36, 23.5{\%}) had significantly lower BMI (p < 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.01) compared with those who exceeded this recommendation. Findings suggest specific intervention programmes may be designed to target both cardiorespiratory fitness and sedentary behaviours to maximize early adolescent health because these behaviours are likely to have unique and independent effects on youth health markers.},

abstract = {Background: A smart accelerometer named the Fitbit has recently been introduced in the consumer market as a physical activity monitor that can interface wirelessly with mobile phones and a manufacturer-established website to allow consumers to track their physical activity in real-time. The purpose of this study was to examine the validity and reliability of the Fitbit for measuring energy expenditure during treadmill walking and running relative to energy expenditure assessed by indirect calorimetry. Methods: A total of 23 healthy adults (10 males, mean age: 30.6 {\{}+/-{\}} 7.9 years; mean BMI: 24.7 {\{}+/-{\}} 3.0 kg/m2) completed a four-phase treadmill exercise protocol (6 min/phase) under laboratory conditions. The protocol consisted of walking at slow (1.9 mph), moderate (3.0 mph), and brisk (4.0 mph) paces; and jogging (5.2 mph). Participants were fitted with three hip-based Fitbit One devices (two on right, one on left hip) and two wrist-based Fitbit Flex devices (one on right and left wrist). Energy expenditure was measured by gas exchange indirect calorimetry. Results: The mean difference of Fitbit-estimated energy expenditure from measured energy expenditure ranged from -0.8 to 0.4 kcals and -0.2 to 2.6 kcals for the hip- and wrist-based Fitbit devices, respectively (see Table). The greatest differences were seen in the wrist-based Fitbit during moderate and brisk walking. Across all phases, the within-participant correlation of Fitbit-estimated energy expenditure to measured energy expenditure was 0.86 to 0.87 for all hip devices (two on right, one on left hip) and 0.88 for both wrist devices (left and right wrists). The inter-device correlation between Fitbit-estimated energy expenditure of the right hip devices was 0.96, between right (front-most) and left hip devices was 0.97, and between right and left wrist devices was 0.95. Conclusions: These results suggest that the Fitbit One and Fitbit Flex physical activity monitors are valid and reliable devices for measuring energy expenditure during physical activity.

abstract = {Aging coincides with a decline in LLMS. Preserving LLMS may be considered a very important determinant of functional independence in the elderly. To maintain LLMS the question arises whether habitual physical activities (HPA) can prevent a decline in LLMS. This review aims to determine the relationship between HPA throughout life and LLMS above age 50. Using relevant databases and keywords, 70 studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed and where possible, a meta-analysis was performed. The main findings are: (1) the present level of HPA is positively related to LLMS; (2) HPA in the past has little effect on present LLMS; (3) HPA involving endurance have less influence on LLMS compared to HPA involving strength; (4) people with a stable habitually physically active life are able to delay a decline in LLMS. In conclusion, to obtain a high amount of LLMS during aging, it is important to achieve and maintain a high level of HPA with mainly muscle-strengthening activities.},

abstract = {The health and well-being of all individuals, independent of race, ethnicity, or gender, is a significant public health concern. Despite many improvements in the status of minority health, African American males continue to have the highest age-adjusted mortality rate of any race-sex group in the United States. Such disparities are accounted for by deaths from a number of diseases such as diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer, and cardiovascular disease, as well as by many historical and present social and cultural constructs that present as obstacles to better health outcomes. Distrust of the medical community, inadequate education, low socioeconomic status, social deprivation, and underutilized primary health care services all contribute to disproportionate health and health care outcomes among African Americans compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Results of clinical research on diseases that disproportionately affect African American males are often limited in their reliability due to common sampling errors existing in the majority of biomedical research studies and clinical trials. There are many reasons for underrepresentation of African American males in clinical trials, including their common recollection and interpretation of relevant historical of biomedical events where minorities were abused or exposed to racial discrimination or racist provocation. In addition, African American males continue to be less educated and more disenfranchised from the majority in society than Caucasian males and females and their African American female counterparts. As such, understanding their perceptions, even in early developmental years, about health and obstacles to involvement in research is important. In an effort to understand perspectives about their level of participation, motivation for participation, impact of education, and engagement in research, this study was designed to explore factors that impact their willingness to participate. Our research suggests that: (1) African American males across all ages are willing to participate in several types of research studies, even those that require human samples; (2) their level of participation is significantly influenced by education level; and (3) their decision to participate in research studies is motivated by civic duty, monetary compensation, and whether they or a relative has had the disease of interest. However, African American males, across all age groups, continue to report a lack of trust as a primary reason for their unwillingness to participate in biomedical research.

Such communication and dialogues should occur at all age levels of research development to assess. current attitudes and behaviors of African American males around participation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Walking to school is associated with higher levels of physical activity, but the contribution of the journey itself to physical activity before school is unknown. PURPOSE: This study combined accelerometer and GPS data to investigate the level and location of physical activity in children walking to school. METHODS: Participants were 137 children (aged 11.3 + or - 0.3 years) from London, England, measured in June-July 2006. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry, and location was determined with a GPS receiver. Travel mode was self-reported. Accelerometer and GPS data were time-matched to provide activity level and location for each 10-second epoch where both were available. Journeys were mapped in a GIS. RESULTS: Mean accelerometer counts per minute before school (8:00 am to 9:00 am) were 43{\%} higher in those who walked to school than those traveling by car (878.8 + or - 387.6 vs 608.7 + or - 264.1 counts per minute [cpm], p<0.001). Eleven percent (4.5 minutes) of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) occurred in this hour, with walkers recording 2.1 minutes more than car travelers (p = 0.004). Children followed direct routes between home and the school playground. Total activity during the walk to school was twice that in the playground (2131.3 + or - 1170.7 vs 1089.7 + or - 938.6 cpm, p<0.001), with the journey contributing three times as much MVPA as time in the playground. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that the journey to school is purposeful and contributes to higher total physical activity and MVPA in children. Combining accelerometer and GPS data may aid our understanding of the environmental context of physical activity.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially since the 1980s. While immigrants are the fastest growing segment of the US population, little is known about obesity or clinician counseling about diet and exercise in this group. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of obesity among immigrant subgroups and quantify the magnitude of the association with duration of US residence, and to describe reported diet and exercise counseling by birthplace, race, and ethnicity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study using data from the 2000 National Health Interview Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index (BMI, measured as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) based on self-reported height and weight measurements, and self-reported rates of diet and exercise counseling. RESULTS: Of 32,374 respondents, 14{\%} were immigrants. The prevalence of obesity was 16{\%} among immigrants and 22{\%} among US-born individuals. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 8{\%} among immigrants living in the United States for less than 1 year, but 19{\%} among those living in the United States for at least 15 years. After adjusting for age, sociodemographic, and lifestyle factors, living in the United States for 10 to 15 and at least 15 years was associated with BMI increases of 0.88 and 1.39, respectively. The association for 15 years or more was significant for all immigrant subgroups except foreign-born blacks. Additionally, immigrants were less likely than US-born individuals to report discussing diet and exercise with clinicians (18{\%} vs 24{\%}, P<.001; 19{\%} vs 23{\%}, P<.001, respectively). These differences were not accounted for by sociodemographic characteristics, illness burden, BMI, or access to care among some subgroups of immigrants. CONCLUSIONS: Among different immigrant subgroups, number of years of residence in the United States is associated with higher BMI beginning after 10 years. The prevalence of obesity among immigrants living in the United States for at least 15 years approached that of US-born adults. Early intervention with diet and physical activity may represent an opportunity to prevent weight gain, obesity, and obesity-related chronic illnesses.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine associations of the neighborhood and home television environments with young children's physical activity. METHOD: 32 boys and 27 girls age 4 to 7 years wore accelerometers for 3 weekdays and 1 weekend day. The number of televisions in the home and television watching of the child were monitored using TV Allowance units for 3 weeks. A geographic information system was used to measure neighborhood environment variables. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analysis was used to predict physical activity, initially controlling for sex, age, socioeconomic status, adiposity, and child television watching in step 1. In step 2, the number of televisions did not significantly increase the amount of variability accounted for in the prediction of physical activity. In step 3, housing density and the interaction of housing density by sex accounted for an incremental 12{\%} (p < 0.05) of the variability and in step 4 percentage park plus recreation area accounted for a further 10{\%} (p < 0.05) of the variability. Greater housing density predicted increased physical activity of boys, but not girls. CONCLUSION: Neighborhoods with increased proximity between homes and a greater proportion of park area are associated with greater physical activity in young children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because physical activity may affect hormonal concentrations and energy balance, we decided to investigate whether everyday exercise is related to the risk of breast cancer. METHODS: During 1974 to 1978 and 1977 to 1983, a total of 25,624 women, 20 to 54 years of age at entry, enrolled in health surveys and answered questionnaires about leisure-time and work activity. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 13.7 years, we identified 351 cases of invasive breast cancer among the 25,624 women in the cohort. Greater leisure-time activity was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, after adjustments for age, body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters), height, parity, and county of residence (relative risk, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.95), among women who exercised regularly, as compared with sedentary women (P for trend=0.04). In regularly exercising women, the reduction in risk was greater in premenopausal women than in postmenopausal women, and greater in younger women (<45 years at study entry) than in older women (> or =45 years) (relative risk, 0.38; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.79). In stratified analyses the risk of breast cancer was lowest in lean women (body-mass index, <22.8) who exercised at least four hours per week (relative risk, 0.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.70). The risk was also reduced with higher levels of activity at work, and again there was a more pronounced effect among premenopausal than postmenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity during leisure time and at work is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a school-based interdisciplinary health behavior intervention on diet and physical activity among children in grades 4 and 5. DESIGN: A quasiexperimental field trial with 6 intervention and 8 matched control schools. Outcomes were assessed longitudinally using preintervention (fall 1995) and follow-up (spring 1997) student survey food frequency and activity measures and follow-up 24-hour recall measures of diet and activity. Change was also assessed using yearly repeated cross-sectional surveys of all grade 5 students from 1995 through 1997. PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal data were collected from 479 students initially in grade 4 in Baltimore, Md, public schools; 91{\%} were African American. Repeated 24-hour recall measures in 1997 were collected for a random subsample of 336 students. Cross-sectional survey data were collected from all grade 5 students in 1995,1996, and 1997 (n = 2103). INTERVENTION: The Eat Well and Keep Moving Program was taught by classroom teachers over 2 years in math, science, language arts, and social studies classes. Materials provided links to school food services and families and provided training and wellness programs for teachers and other staff members. Intervention materials focused on decreasing consumption of foods high in total and saturated fat and increasing fruit and vegetable intake, as well as reducing television viewing and increasing physical activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dietary intake and physical activity measured via repeated 24-hour recall were primary end points, with additional food frequency and activity measures. RESULTS: The 24-hour recall measures indicated that, after controlling for baseline covariates, the percentages of total energy from fat and saturated fat were reduced among students in intervention compared with control schools (-1.4{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -2.8 to -0.04; P = .04 and -0.60{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -1.2 to -0.01; P = .05). There was an increase in fruit and vegetable intake (0.36 servings/4184 kJ; 95{\%} CI, 0.10-0.62; P=.01), in vitamin C intake (8.8 mg/4184 kJ; 95{\%} CI, 2.0-16; P=.01), and in fiber consumption (0.7 g/4184 kJ; 95{\%} CI, 0.0-1.4; P=.05). Television viewing was marginally reduced (-0.55 h/d; 95{\%} CI, -1.04 to 0.04; P=.06). Analysis of longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional food frequency data indicated similar significant decreases in the percentages of total energy from fat and saturated fat. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the Eat Well and Keep Moving Program indicates effectiveness in improving dietary intake of students and reducing television viewing.},

Due to learned expectations of system unreliability, users are skeptical of the authenticity of Fitbit-recorded data. However, due to the limited visibility of system status their efforts to test and calibrate their data are ultimately flawed. Users move through four main phases in which they perform a number of tests to diagnose and understand the Fitbit’s level of precision, while revising their mental model of the Fitbit itself and attempting to calibrate their personal use of the device. This paper examines the results of seven interviews with Fitbit users, hypothesizes and describes four phases of use many Fitbit users undergo, and critiques the usability problems that these interviews unearthed.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The potential synergistic effects of multiple dietary and physical activity behaviours on the risk of chronic conditions and health outcomes is a key issue for public health. This study examined the prevalence and clustering patterns of multiple health behaviours among a sample of adolescents in the UK. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 176 adolescents aged 12-16 years (49{\%} boys). Adolescents wore accelerometers for seven days and completed a questionnaire assessing fruit, vegetable, and breakfast consumption. The prevalence of adolescents meeting the physical activity (>/= 60 minutes moderate-to-vigorous physical activity/day), fruit and vegetable (>/= 5 portions of FV per day) and breakfast recommendations (eating breakfast on >/= 5 days per week), and clustering patterns of these health behaviours are described. RESULTS: Boys were more active than girls (p < 0.001) and younger adolescents were more active than older adolescents (p < 0.01). Boys ate breakfast on more days per week than girls (p < 0.01) and older adolescents ate more fruit and vegetables than younger adolescents (p < 0.01). Almost 54{\%} of adolescents had multiple risk behaviours and only 6{\%} achieved all three of the recommendations. Girls had significantly more risk factors than boys (p < 0.01). For adolescents with two risk behaviours, the most prevalent cluster was formed by not meeting the physical activity and fruit and vegetable recommendations. CONCLUSION: Many adolescents fail to meet multiple diet and physical activity recommendations, highlighting that physical activity and dietary behaviours do not occur in isolation. Future research should investigate how best to achieve multiple health behaviour change in adolescent boys and girls.},

abstract = {Interest in studying the impact of acculturation on immigrant health has increased in tandem with the growth of the Latino population in the United States. Linear assimilation models continue to dominate public health research despite the availability of more complex acculturation theories that propose multidimensional frameworks, reciprocal interactions between the individual and the environment, and other acculturative processes among various Latino groups. Because linear and unidimensional assessments (e.g., nativity, length of stay in the United States, and language use) provide constricted measures of acculturation, the rare use of multidimensional acculturation measures and models has inhibited a more comprehensive understanding of the association between specific components of acculturation and particular health outcomes. A public health perspective that incorporates the roles of structural and cultural forces in acculturation may help identify mechanisms underlying links between acculturation and health among Latinos.},

This ethnography of the Quantified Self movement, where participants collect extensive data about their own bodies, identifies practices that go beyond simply internalizing predetermined frameworks. The QS movement attracts the most hungrily panoptical of the data aggregation businesses in addition to people who have developed their own notions of analytics that are separate from, and in relation to, dominant practices of firms and institutionalized scientific production. Their practices constitute an important modality of resistance to dominant modes of living with data, an approach that we call “soft resistance.” Soft resistance happens when participants assume multiple roles as project designers, data collectors, and critical sense-makers who rapidly shift priorities. This constant shifting keeps data sets fragmented and thus creates material resistance to traditional modes of data aggregation. It also breaks the categories that make traditional aggregations appear authoritative. This enables participants to partially yet significantly escape the frames created by the biopolitics of the health technology industry. I},

Although these technologies have varied ways of providing real-time feedback on a user's current progress, we have a dearth of knowledge of the framing effects on the performance feedback these tools provide. With an aim to create influential, persuasive performance feedback that will nudge people toward healthy behaviors, we conducted an online experiment to investigate the effect of framing on an individual's self-efficacy. We identified 3 different types of framing that can be applicable in presenting performance feedback: (1) the valence of performance (remaining vs. achieved framing), (2) presentation type (text-only vs. text with visual), and (3) data unit (raw vs. percentage). Results show that the achieved framing could lead to an increased perception of individual's performance capabilities. This work provides empirical guidance for creating persuasive performance feedback, thereby helping people designing self-monitoring technologies to promote healthy behaviors.},

abstract = {To improve the measurement of usual dietary intake, the National Cancer Institute developed a cognitively based Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ), which has been validated against four 24-h dietary recalls (4 24-HR) for energy, macronutrients, and several vitamins and minerals. This analysis used data from The Eating at America's Table Study (EATS) to determine the validity of estimates for carotenoids and tocopherols from the DHQ. Over the course of a year, 163 participants provided 1 or 2 blood samples and completed the DHQ and 4 24-HR. For both the DHQ and the 4 24-HR, crude correlations between serum and diet were modest to strong for the provitamin A carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin), low to modest for lycopene, and very low for lutein. The individual dietary tocopherols were weakly correlated with the serum tocopherols, but vitamin E from food and dietary supplements was strongly and positively correlated with serum alpha-tocopherol and strongly and inversely correlated with serum gamma-tocopherol for both instruments. Adjustment for energy, BMI, smoking status, serum total cholesterol, and serum triacylglycerol did not appreciably change the correlations. Using the method of triads, validity coefficients for the DHQ were comparable to the 4 24-HR and were especially strong for alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein + zeaxanthin, and total vitamin E in men and gamma-tocopherol and total vitamin E in women. In this study, there was no advantage of 2 blood samples over 1, suggesting reasonably stable ranking of individuals for these biomarkers, which is important for large epidemiologic studies that typically obtain only 1 blood sample for biomarker status.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the objectively measured physical activity characteristics of a diverse sample of sixth-grade girls, to examine influences on physical activity, and to report compliance with physical activity guidelines. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Six locations across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1578 sixth-grade girls. Accelerometers were worn for 7 days, and data for 6 days were included in the analyses. Main Exposures Race/ethnicity, free or reduced-price lunch, and geographic region. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six operational definitions of adequate activity (60 or 30 minutes of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity at or above 4.6, 3.8, or 3.0 metabolic equivalents) were used to examine whether girls met physical activity guidelines. RESULTS: Average times spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activities were 460, 342, 18, and 6 min/d, respectively. White girls were more active than girls in other race/ethnic groups, and girls who did not receive free or reduced-price lunch were more active than girls who did. Girls in western states were most active. Percentages of girls in compliance with the 6 thresholds for adequate activity varied widely and ranged from 0.6{\%} to 100.0{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: When physical activity is measured objectively and a 4.6-metabolic equivalents cut point for moderate to vigorous physical activity is used, most sixth-grade girls do not meet guidelines for adequate physical activity. One notable finding was the effect of different accelerometer scoring protocols on estimates of compliance. Conceptual and empirical work is needed to define appropriate physical activity for youth using objective physical activity measures.},

abstract = {We re-examine the pace of rising obesity among Hispanic immigrants and the effects associated with longer duration in the US, or what is referred to as unhealthy assimilation, the convergence of immigrant health to a less healthy native-born standard. Consistent with previous research, we find that across all race-ethnic groups, immigrants tend to be less obese than native-born persons. Second, obesity is clearly on the rise, with obesity rates increasing for both immigrant and native-born populations between 1995 and 2005. However, our findings are that immigrant obesity rises more slowly than for native-born Hispanics in the same age cohort. The significance is that immigrants do not converge to obesity prevalence of the native-born as commonly assumed and, in fact, the differential is wider in 2005 than it was in 1995. The analysis, which is based on the National Health Interview Survey tracks the obesity rates of different cohort populations observed in repeated cross-sections (1995 and 2005), as both immigrants and the native-born grow older and additionally, as immigrants reside in the U.S. longer. More specifically, for immigrants, our study distinguishes the effects of length of U.S. residence (observed at a single point in time) and increasing duration of residence (observed over time). Of crucial importance, we contrast the changes over time for native and foreign-born residents passing through the same age range from 1995 to 2005. Misconclusions of previous research stem from 1) assuming that any change for immigrants equates to assimilation, without regard to native-born change, and 2) an unbalanced analysis that fails to track in parallel the growing obesity of both immigrant and native-born cohorts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. To date, relationships between obesity and aspects of the built environment have not been evaluated empirically at the individual level. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the built environment around each participant's place of residence and self-reported travel patterns (walking and time in a car), body mass index (BMI), and obesity for specific gender and ethnicity classifications. METHODS: Body Mass Index, minutes spent in a car, kilometers walked, age, income, educational attainment, and gender were derived through a travel survey of 10,878 participants in the Atlanta, Georgia region. Objective measures of land use mix, net residential density, and street connectivity were developed within a 1-kilometer network distance of each participant's place of residence. A cross-sectional design was used to associate urban form measures with obesity, BMI, and transportation-related activity when adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. Discrete analyses were conducted across gender and ethnicity. The data were collected between 2000 and 2002 and analysis was conducted in 2004. RESULTS: Land-use mix had the strongest association with obesity (BMI >/= 30 kg/m(2)), with each quartile increase being associated with a 12.2{\%} reduction in the likelihood of obesity across gender and ethnicity. Each additional hour spent in a car per day was associated with a 6{\%} increase in the likelihood of obesity. Conversely, each additional kilometer walked per day was associated with a 4.8{\%} reduction in the likelihood of obesity. As a continuous measure, BMI was significantly associated with urban form for white cohorts. Relationships among urban form, walk distance, and time in a car were stronger among white than black cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Measures of the built environment and travel patterns are important predictors of obesity across gender and ethnicity, yet relationships among the built environment, travel patterns, and weight may vary across gender and ethnicity. Strategies to increase land-use mix and distance walked while reducing time in a car can be effective as health interventions.},

abstract = {The capacity of public parks and recreation environments to promote physical activity for low-income communities of color is receiving increased attention from researchers and policymakers. As a result, several systems to measure park and recreation environments have been recently developed. Developing measures is important because they are critical to establishing key correlates and determinants that drive physical activity and inform intervention strategies. This paper briefly reviews recently developed approaches for measuring physical environments within public parks and recreation areas. It critiques the capacity of these approaches to advance an understanding of how parks and recreation settings contribute to physical activity in low-income communities of color. Residents of low-income communities of color are usually found to have lower physical activity, and this may be due partly to a disparity in access to parks and other recreation environments. Three primary recommendations are presented. First, future measurement tools should explicitly reflect inequality in the built environment in terms of availability and quality of parks and recreation areas. Second, measurement strategies should incorporate research on recreation activity and setting preferences important in low-income communities of color. Finally, the perceptions of residents of low-income communities of color should be reflected in measurement approaches. One strategy for incorporating the perceptions is community-based participatory research. The rapid development of high-quality tools for measuring parks and recreation environments is encouraging. However, existing measures should be tested and refined in varying social-ecologic conditions, and new tools should be developed specifically for nuances associated with low-income minority communities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a recent proliferation in the development of smartphone applications (apps) aimed at modifying various health behaviours. While interventions that incorporate behaviour change techniques (BCTs) have been associated with greater effectiveness, it is not clear to what extent smartphone apps incorporate such techniques. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of BCTs in physical activity and dietary apps and determine how reliably the taxonomy checklist can be used to identify BCTs in smartphone apps.

METHODS: The top-20 paid and top-20 free physical activity and/or dietary behaviour apps from the New Zealand Apple App Store Health {\&} Fitness category were downloaded to an iPhone. Four independent raters user-tested and coded each app for the presence/absence of BCTs using the taxonomy of behaviour change techniques (26 BCTs in total). The number of BCTs included in the 40 apps was calculated. Krippendorff's alpha was used to evaluate interrater reliability for each of the 26 BCTs.

RESULTS: Apps included an average of 8.1 (range 2-18) techniques, the number being slightly higher for paid (M = 9.7, range 2-18) than free apps (M = 6.6, range 3-14). The most frequently included BCTs were "provide instruction" (83{\%} of the apps), "set graded tasks" (70{\%}), and "prompt self-monitoring" (60{\%}). Techniques such as "teach to use prompts/cues", "agree on behavioural contract", "relapse prevention" and "time management" were not present in the apps reviewed. Interrater reliability coefficients ranged from 0.1 to 0.9 (Mean 0.6, SD = 0.2).

CONCLUSIONS: Presence of BCTs varied by app type and price; however, BCTs associated with increased intervention effectiveness were in general more common in paid apps. The taxonomy checklist can be used by independent raters to reliably identify BCTs in physical activity and dietary behaviour smartphone apps.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schools are the most frequent target for intervention programs aimed at preventing child obesity; however, the overall effectiveness of these programs has been limited. It has therefore been recommended that interventions target multiple ecological levels (community, family, school and individual) to have greater success in changing risk behaviors for obesity. This study examined the immediate and short-term, sustained effects of the Switch program, which targeted three behaviors (decreasing children's screen time, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, and increasing physical activity) at three ecological levels (the family, school, and community). METHODS: Participants were 1,323 children and their parents from 10 schools in two states. Schools were matched and randomly assigned to treatment and control. Measures of the key behaviors and body mass index were collected at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. RESULTS: The effect sizes of the differences between treatment and control groups ranged between small (Cohen's d = 0.15 for body mass index at 6 months post-intervention) to large (1.38; parent report of screen time at 6 months post-intervention), controlling for baseline levels. There was a significant difference in parent-reported screen time at post-intervention in the experimental group, and this effect was maintained at 6 months post-intervention (a difference of about 2 hours/week). The experimental group also showed a significant increase in parent-reported fruit and vegetable consumption while child-reported fruit and vegetable consumption was marginally significant. At the 6-month follow-up, parent-reported screen time was significantly lower, and parent and child-reported fruit and vegetable consumption was significantly increased. There were no significant effects on pedometer measures of physical activity or body mass index in the experimental group. The intervention effects were moderated by child sex (for fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, and weight status), family involvement (for fruit and vegetable consumption), and child body mass index (for screen time). The perception of change among the experimental group was generally positive with 23{\%} to 62{\%} indicating positive changes in behaviors. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the Switch program yielded small-to-modest treatment effects for promoting children's fruit and vegetable consumption and minimizing screen time. The Switch program offers promise for use in youth obesity prevention.},

The rise of Big Data in the social realm poses significant questions at the intersection of science, technology, and society, including in terms of how new large-scale social databases are currently changing the methods, epistemologies, and politics of social science. In this commentary, we address such epochal (“large-scale”) questions by way of a (situated) experiment: at the Danish Technical University in Copenhagen, an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, physicists, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists (including the authors) is setting up a large-scale data infrastructure, meant to continually record the digital traces of social relations among an entire freshman class of students ( N  > 1000). At the same time, fieldwork is carried out on friendship (and other) relations amongst the same group of students. On this basis, the question we pose is the following: what kind of knowledge is obtained on this social micro-cosmos via the Big (computational, quantitative) and Small (embodied, qualitative) Data, respectively? How do the two relate? Invoking Bohr’s principle of complementarity as analogy, we hypothesize that social relations, as objects of knowledge, depend crucially on the type of measurement device deployed. At the same time, however, we also expect new interferences and polyphonies to arise at the intersection of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so to speak, mixed with care. These questions, we stress, are important not only for the future of social science methods but also for the type of societal (self-)knowledge that may be expected from new large-scale social databases.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are currently over 1000 exercise apps for mobile devices on the market. These apps employ a range of features, from tracking exercise activity to providing motivational messages. However, virtually nothing is known about whether exercise apps improve exercise levels and health outcomes and, if so, the mechanisms of these effects.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine whether the use of exercise apps is associated with increased levels of exercise and improved health outcomes. We also develop a framework within which to understand how exercise apps may affect health and test multiple models of possible mechanisms of action and boundary conditions of these relationships. Within this framework, app use may increase physical activity by influencing variables such as self-efficacy and may help to overcome exercise barriers, leading to improved health outcomes such as lower body mass index (BMI).

METHODS: In this study, 726 participants with one of three backgrounds were surveyed about their use of exercise apps and health: (1) those who never used exercise apps, (2) those who used exercise apps but discontinued use, and (3) those who are currently using exercise apps. Participants were asked about their long-term levels of exercise and about their levels of exercise during the previous week with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ).

RESULTS: Nearly three-quarters of current app users reported being more active compared to under half of non-users and past users. The IPAQ showed that current users had higher total leisure time metabolic equivalent of task (MET) expenditures (1169 METs), including walking and vigorous exercise, compared to those who stopped using their apps (612 METs) or who never used apps (577 METs). Importantly, physical activity levels in domains other than leisure time activity were similar across the groups. The results also showed that current users had lower BMI (25.16) than past users (26.8) and non-users (26.9) and that this association was mediated by exercise levels and self-efficacy. That relationship was also moderated by perceived barriers to exercise. Multiple serial mediation models were tested, which revealed that the association between app use and BMI is mediated by increased self-efficacy and increased exercise.

CONCLUSIONS: Exercise app users are more likely to exercise during their leisure time, compared to those who do not use exercise apps, essentially fulfilling the role that many of these apps were designed to accomplish. Data also suggest that one way that exercise apps may increase exercise levels and health outcomes such as BMI is by making it easier for users to overcome barriers to exercise, leading to increased self-efficacy. We discuss ways of improving the effectiveness of apps by incorporating theory-driven approaches. We conclude that exercise apps can be viewed as intervention delivery systems consisting of features that help users overcome specific barriers.},

Methods: Feedback via focus groups (n = 38) and exit questionnaires (n = 68) was used to examine participants' experiences in a group-based, pedometer-based physical activity (PA) program delivered in the workplace.  Results: The pedometer was described as a useful tool for increasing awareness of PA, providing motivation and visual feedback, and encouraging conversation and support among participants and others such as family and friends. Group meetings provided motivation and social support, as did participation by coworkers. Self-selected goals, self-selected PA strategies, and recording of steps/d were also important.  Conclusions: Given the importance of social support as a mediating variable in changing PA behavior, future pedometer-based programs might benefit from including a group-based component.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A learning health system enables patients, clinicians, and researchers to work together to choose care based on the best evidence, drive discovery as a natural outgrowth of patient care, and ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in health care; all in a more real-time fashion.

OBJECTIVE: Our paper describes how goal-directed design (GDD) methods were employed to understand the context and goals of potential participants in such a system as part of a design process to translate the concept of a learning health system into a prototype collaborative chronic care network (C3N), specifically for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.

METHODS: Thirty-six one-on-one in-depth interviews and observations were conducted with patients (10/36, 28{\%}), caregivers (10/36, 28{\%}), physicians/researchers (10/36, 28{\%}), and nurses (6/36, 17{\%}) from a pediatric gastroenterology center participating in the ImproveCareNow network. GDD methods were used to determine the context and goals of participants. These same methods were used in conjunction with idealized design process techniques to help determine characteristics of a learning health system for this pediatric health care ecology. Research was conducted in a clinic and, in the case of some patients and caregivers, at home.

RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed 3 parent-child dyad personas (ie, representations of interviewees' behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and contextual information) that represented adaptation to a chronic illness over time. These were used as part of a design process to generate scenarios (potential interactions between personas and the learning health system under design) from which system requirements were derived. These scenarios in turn helped guide generation, prioritization, design, measurement, and implementation of approximately 100 prototype interventions consistent with the aim of C3N becoming a learning health network.

CONCLUSIONS: GDD methods help ensure human goals and contexts inform the design of a network of health care interventions which reflect the shape and purpose of a C3N in pediatric chronic illness care. Developing online and in-person interventions according to well-documented context and motivations of participants increases the likelihood that a C3N will enable all participants to act in ways that achieve their goals with grace and dignity. GDD methods complemented quality-improvement methods to generate prototypes consistent with clinical and research aims, as well as the goals of patient disease management.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:                       Although polysomnography is necessary for diagnosis of most sleep disorders, it is also expensive, time-consuming, intrusive, and interferes with sleep. Field-based activity monitoring is increasingly used as an alternative measure that can be used to answer certain clinical and research questions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of a novel activity monitoring device (Fitbit) compared to both polysomnography and standard actigraphy (Actiwatch-64).                                         METHODS:                       To test validity, simultaneous Fitbit and actigraph were worn during standard overnight polysomnography by 24 healthy adults at the West Virginia University sleep research laboratory. To test inter-Fitbit reliability, three participants also wore two of the Fitbit devices overnight at home.                                         RESULTS:                       Fitbit showed high intradevice reliability =96.5-99.1. Fitbit and actigraph differed significantly on recorded total sleep time and sleep efficiency between each other and polysomnography. Bland-Altman plots indicated that both Fitbit and actigraph overestimated sleep efficiency and total sleep time. Sensitivity of both Fitbit and actigraphy for accurately identifying sleep was high within all sleep stages and during arousals; specificity of both Fitbit and actigraph for accurately identifying wake was poor. Specificity of actigraph was higher except for wake before sleep onset; sensitivity of Fitbit was higher in all sleep stages and during arousals.                                         CONCLUSIONS:                       The web-based Fitbit, available at a markedly reduced price and with several convenience factors compared to standard actigraphy, may be an acceptable activity measurement instrument for use with normative populations. However, Fitbit has the same specificity limitations as actigraphy; both devices consistently misidentify wake as sleep and thus overestimate both sleep time and quality. Use of the Fitbit will also require specific validation before it can be used to assess disordered populations and or different age groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Activity trackers can potentially stimulate users to increase their physical activity behavior. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of ten consumer activity trackers for measuring step count in both laboratory and free-living conditions.

METHOD: Healthy adult volunteers (n = 33) walked twice on a treadmill (4.8 km/h) for 30 min while wearing ten different activity trackers (i.e. Lumoback, Fitbit Flex, Jawbone Up, Nike+ Fuelband SE, Misfit Shine, Withings Pulse, Fitbit Zip, Omron HJ-203, Yamax Digiwalker SW-200 and Moves mobile application). In free-living conditions, 56 volunteers wore the same activity trackers for one working day. Test-retest reliability was analyzed with the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Validity was evaluated by comparing each tracker with the gold standard (Optogait system for laboratory and ActivPAL for free-living conditions), using paired samples t-tests, mean absolute percentage errors, correlations and Bland-Altman plots.

RESULTS: Test-retest analysis revealed high reliability for most trackers except for the Omron (ICC .14), Moves app (ICC .37) and Nike+ Fuelband (ICC .53). The mean absolute percentage errors of the trackers in laboratory and free-living conditions respectively, were: Lumoback (-0.2, -0.4), Fibit Flex (-5.7, 3.7), Jawbone Up (-1.0, 1.4), Nike+ Fuelband (-18, -24), Misfit Shine (0.2, 1.1), Withings Pulse (-0.5, -7.9), Fitbit Zip (-0.3, 1.2), Omron (2.5, -0.4), Digiwalker (-1.2, -5.9), and Moves app (9.6, -37.6). Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that the limits of agreement varied from 46 steps (Fitbit Zip) to 2422 steps (Nike+ Fuelband) in the laboratory condition, and 866 steps (Fitbit Zip) to 5150 steps (Moves app) in the free-living condition.

CONCLUSION: The reliability and validity of most trackers for measuring step count is good. The Fitbit Zip is the most valid whereas the reliability and validity of the Nike+ Fuelband is low.},

abstract = {Promoting physical activity has become a priority because of its role in preventing childhood obesity and chronic disease. Ecological approaches that recognise the interaction between individuals and the settings in which they spend their time are currently at the forefront of public health action. Schools have been identified as a key setting for health promotion. An overview of the literature addressed the promotion of physical activity in schools and showed that school-based strategies (elementary or high school) that utilised classroom-based education only did not increase physical activity levels; one notable exception was screen time interventions. Although evidence is sparse, active school models and environmental strategies (interventions that change policy and practice) appear to promote physical activity in elementary schools effectively. There is also strong evidence to support multicomponent models in high schools, particularly models that incorporate a family and community component. An emerging trend is to involve youth in the development and implementation of interventions. In the context of childhood obesity and sedentary lifestyles, modest increases in physical activity levels in school-based trials are important. School initiatives must be supported and reinforced in other community settings. Health professionals play a key role as champions in the community, based on their influence and credibility. Health professionals can lend support to school-based efforts by asking about and emphasising the importance of physical activity with patients, encouraging family-based activities, supporting local schools to adopt an "active school" approach and advocating for support to sustain evidence-based and promising physical activity models within schools.},

DESIGN: Observational epidemiological study. SUBJECTS: One thousand forty eight working adults. Using a multistage sampling design on neighbourhood SES, participants were from high and low SES neighbourhoods of an Australian capital city. MEASUREMENTS: Neighbourhood SES was assessed using census data; individual SES was based on self-reported educational attainment and household income. There were three sitting time variables: sitting time on weekdays, weekend days and in leisure time. Overweight and obesity were determined using self-reported body weight and height. RESULTS: Gender, age, neighbourhood SES, education, working hours and physical activity were independently associated with weekday, weekend day and leisure-related sitting time. With the exception of education and working hours, these variables were also independently associated with being overweight or obese. Leisure-time sitting was found to be a mediator in the relationships between gender, education and being overweight or obese. CONCLUSION: Strategies to promote less sitting in leisure time are required to combat overweight and obesity in Australian adults, especially among those from low SES neighbourhoods, and among those with high levels of education and income who work long hours.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schools must play a central role in combating the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and youths. This cannot be achieved without more robust policy and funding programs at both federal and state levels. METHODS: Reviews of meta-analyses were used to assess the efficacy of improving PA/MVPA through interventions in school physical education programs. Individual research studies were reviewed to assess the efficacy of improving PA/MVPA in preschool settings, recess, and classroom activity breaks. Legislation at the federal and state levels was reviewed along with surveillance and accountability mechanisms at the state level. RESULTS: Physical education interventions produce improvements in PA/MVPA if protocols relating to use of time are followed. PA/MVPA in recess can be increased through careful planning for attractive activity opportunities on carefully designed playgrounds. Classroom activity breaks provide important PA/MVPA daily and improve student on-task behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Federal legislation is needed to provide guidelines and financial support for states to improve the quantity and quality of PA in school programs. States need to develop clear expectations for quantity and quality of PA programs in schools, surveillance systems to monitor district compliance in meeting those expectations, and an accountability system aimed at ensuring that state expectations are being met with assistance for districts that do not meet expectations.},

The experimental group took part in an aerobic running programme, whereas the control group were asked not to vary their everyday activities. We found a significant increase in visuospatial memory performance and a significant increase in positive affect on a .05 alpha level of significance. However, we observed no effects of running training on concentration performance and verbal memory. We conclude that physical activity can possibly serve as a means to improve positively valenced aspects of affect and benefit visuospatial but not verbal memory in young adults.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Accelerometers were incorporated in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) study cycle for objective assessment of physical activity. This is the first time that objective physical activity data are available on a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. The use of accelerometers allows researchers to measure total physical activity, including light intensity and unstructured activities, which may be a better predictor of health outcomes than structured activity alone. The aim of this study was to examine objectively determined physical activity levels by sex, age and racial/ethnic groups in a national sample of U.S. adults. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2003-2004 NHANES, a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability sample of the U.S. population. Physical activity was assessed with the Actigraph AM-7164 accelerometer for seven days following an examination. 2,688 U.S. adults with valid accelerometer data (i.e. at least four days with at least 10 hours of wear-time) were included in the analysis. Mean daily total physical activity counts, as well as counts accumulated in minutes of light, and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity are presented by sex across age and racial/ethnic groups. Generalized linear modeling using the log link function was performed to compare physical activity in sex and racial/ethnic groups adjusting for age. RESULTS: Physical activity decreases with age for both men and women across all racial/ethnic groups with men being more active than women, with the exception of Hispanic women. Hispanic women are more active at middle age (40-59 years) compared to younger or older age and not significantly less active than men in middle or older age groups (i.e. age 40-59 or age 60 and older). Hispanic men accumulate more total and light intensity physical activity counts than their white and black counterparts for all age groups. CONCLUSION: Physical activity levels measured objectively by accelerometer demonstrated that Hispanic men are, in general, more active than their white and black counterparts. This appears to be in contrast to self-reported physical activity previously reported in the literature and identifies the need to use objective measures in situations where the contribution of light intensity and/or unstructured physical activity cannot be assumed homogenous across the populations of interest.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between objective measures of sedentary behavior and cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in adolescents. A secondary aim was to evaluate the degree of association between overall and abdominal adiposity and CRFs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 210 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Measurements were made of the sum of the skinfold thicknesses at six locations (sum6), waist circumference (WC), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoproteins A-1 and B-100. A CRF score was calculated from the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and TG, HDL-C and glucose levels. Sedentary behavior was assessed over 7 days using an accelerometer. Participants were divided into tertiles according to sedentary behavior and into low and high levels of overall (sum6) and abdominal (WC) adiposity. RESULTS: Adolescents with a high level of sedentary behavior had less favorable SBP, TG and glucose levels and CRF scores. Adolescents with a high level of overall adiposity demonstrated significant differences in five of the 11 variables analyzed (i.e. DBP, LDL-C, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score), while adolescents with a high level of abdominal adiposity had differences in eight (i.e. SBP, MAP, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score). Adolescents with high levels of both overall and abdominal adiposity and sedentary behavior had the least favorable CRF scores. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behavior was associated with CRFs in adolescents, especially in obese adolescents. Abdominal adiposity seemed to play a more significant role in the development of CRFs than overall adiposity.},

Comparing physical activity scores with peers can contribute to the desired behavioural change. However, for meaningful social comparison a high inter-device reliability is paramount. This study aimed to determine the inter-device reliability of Fitbit activity trackers in measuring steps. Ten activity trackers (Fitbit Ultra) were worn by a single person (male, 46 years) during eight consecutive days. Inter-device reliability was assessed on three different levels of aggregation (minutes, hours, days) with various methods, including intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), Bland-Altman plots, limits of agreement (LOA) and Mixed Model Analysis.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess developmental trends in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in British adolescents in relation to sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). DESIGN: A 5-year longitudinal study of a diverse cohort of students aged 11-12 years at baseline in 1999. SETTING: 36 London schools sampled using a stratified random sampling procedure. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5863 students categorised as white, black or Asian, and stratified for SES using the Townsend Index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of days per week of vigorous activity leading to sweating and breathing hard. Hours of sedentary behaviour, including watching television and playing video games. Data were analysed using multilevel, linear, mixed models. RESULTS: Marked reductions in physical activity and increases in sedentary behaviour were noticed between ages 11-12 and 15-16 years. Boys were more active than girls, and the decline in physical activity was greater in girls (46{\%} reduction) than in boys (23{\%}). Asian students were less active than whites, and this was also true of black girls but not boys. Black students were more sedentary than white students. Levels of sedentary behaviour were greater in respondents from lower SES. Most differences between ethnic and SES groups were present at age 11 years, and did not evolve over the teenage years. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity declines and sedentary behaviour becomes more common during adolescence. Ethnic and SES differences are observed in physical activity and sedentary behaviour in British youth that anticipate adult variations in adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk. These are largely established by age 11-12 years, so reversing these patterns requires earlier intervention.},

abstract = {RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This paper addresses the movements 'evidence-based' (EBM) and 'personalized' (PM) medicine. The former is being criticized for failing to do justice to clinical complexity and human individuality. The latter aims at tailoring medical knowledge for every patient in a personalized fashion. Instrumental to this effort is the technological development engendering unlimited amounts of data about bodily fragments. The aim of this article is to stimulate a debate about the notion of the body and knowledge in medicine.

METHODS: An authentic sickness history is used as a vantage point for a more comprehensive account of biomedicine.

RESULTS: The analysis of the sickness history demonstrates how biomedical logic guided all approaches in the care for this particular patient. Each problem was identified and treated separately, whereby neglecting the interaction between body parts and systems, and between the woman's bodily condition and her experiences. The specialists involved seemed to look for phenomena that fit categories of disorders 'belonging' to their field. These approaches engendered unintended effects: chronification, poly-pharmacy and multi-morbidity, leading to an unsustainable increase in medical costs.

CONCLUSIONS: The article elucidates how the status that professionals ascribe to the body has vital implications for what they regard as relevant and how they interpret the information they have collected. On this ground, we challenge both the prevailing and tacitly accepted separation between the physical body and human experience and the view of knowledge underpinning EBM and PM. The growing molecularization of the body veils decisive sources of human illness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing levels of physical inactivity and sedentariness are contributing to the current overweight and obesity epidemic. In this paper, the findings of two recent studies are used to explore the relationships between sitting time (in transport, work and leisure), physical activity and body mass index (BMI) in two contrasting samples of adult Australians. METHODS: Data on sitting time, physical activity, BMI and a number of demographic characteristics were compared for participants in two studies-529 women who were participants in a preschool health promotion project ('mothers'), and 185 men and women who were involved in a workplace pedometer study ('workers'). Relationships between age, number of children, physical activity, sitting time, BMI, gender and work patterns were explored. Logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of being overweight or obese, among participants with different physical activity, sitting time and work patterns. RESULTS: The total reported time spent sitting per day (across all domains) was almost 6 h less among the mothers than the workers (P<0.001), and compared with the mothers, a significantly greater proportion of the workers was classified as overweight or obese (BMI > or =25 kg/m(2)). Univariate analysis found that, compared with men in full-time work, women who worked full-time (OR=0.42, CI: 0.24-0.74), part-time (OR=0.35, CI: 0.20-0.59) or in full-time home duties (OR=0.51, CI: 0.29-0.88) were about half as likely to be overweight or obese. Participants who reported high daily levels of sitting (> or =7.4 h) were also significantly more likely than those who reported 'low' levels (<4.7 h/day) to be overweight or obese (OR=1.68, CI: 1.16-2.42). Multivariate analysis (including physical activity, work patterns and sitting time) confirmed that full-time and part-time working women (but not 'home duties' women) were less likely to report BMI > or =25 kg/m(2) than full-time working men (full-time: OR=0.44, CI: 0.25-0.78; part-time: OR=0.45, CI: 0.24-0.86), but the OR for BMI > or =25 among those in the high sitting category was attenuated (OR=1.61, CI 0.96-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a need for inclusion of measures of both activity and inactivity in future studies, so that the complex relationships between these behavioural determinants of BMI can be clarified.},

abstract = {Background: Health experts recommend daily step goals of 10,000 steps for adults and 12,000 steps for youths to achieve a healthy active living.  This article reports the findings of a Canadian family project to investigate whether the recommended daily step goals are achievable in a real life setting, and suggests ways to increase the daily steps to meet the goal.  The family project also provides an example to encourage more Canadians to conduct family projects on healthy living.

Methods: This is a pilot feasibility study.  A Canadian family was recruited for the study, with 4 volunteers (father, mother, son and daughter).  Each volunteer was asked to wear a pedometer and to record daily steps for three time periods of each day during a 2-month period.  Both minimal routine steps, and additional steps from special non-routine activities, were recorded at work, school and home.  

Results: The mean number of daily steps from routine minimal daily activities for the family was 6685 steps in a day (16 hr, approx 400 steps/hr).  There was thus a mean deficit of 4315 steps per day, or approximately 30,000 steps per week, from the goal (10,000 steps for adults; 12,000 steps for youths).  Special activities that were found to effectively increase the steps above the routine level include: walking at brisk pace, grocery shopping, window shopping in a mall, going to an entertainment centre, and attending parties (such as to celebrate the holiday season and birthdays).

Discussion: To increase our daily steps to meet the daily step goal, a new culture is recommended: “get off the chair”.  By definition, sitting on a chair precludes the opportunity to walk.  We encourage people to get off the chair, to go shopping, and to go partying, as a practical and fun way to increase the daily steps.  This paper is a call for increased physical activity to meet the daily step goal.},

abstract = {Changes in school nutrition and physical activity policies and environments are important to combat childhood obesity. Arkansas Act 1220 of 2003 was among the first and most comprehensive statewide legislative initiatives to combat childhood obesity through school-based change. Annual surveys of principals and superintendents have been analyzed to document substantial and important changes in school environments, policies, and practices. For example, results indicate that schools are more likely to require that healthy options be provided for student parties (4.5{\%} in 2004, 36.9{\%} in 2008; P <or= 0.0001) and concession stands (1.6{\%} in 2004, 19.6{\%} in 2008; P <or= 0.0001), ban commercial advertising by food or beverage companies (31.7{\%} in 2005, 42.6{\%} in 2008; P <or= 0.0001), and offer skim milk options for students in cafeterias (white milk: 26.1{\%} in 2004, 41.0{\%} in 2008, P <or= 0.0001; chocolate milk: 9.0{\%} in 2004, 24.0{\%} in 2008, P <or= 0.0001). They are less likely to have vending machines available during the lunch period (72.3{\%} in 2004, 37.2{\%} in 2008; P <or= 0.0001) and to include sodas in vending machines (83.8{\%} in 2004, 73.5{\%} in 2008; P <or= 0.0001). Other changes were noted in foods and beverages offered in the cafeteria, in classrooms, and at school events, as well as in fund-raising and physical activity practices. A significant number of school districts have modified physical education requirements for elementary schools and developed policies prohibiting the use of physical activity as a punishment. We conclude that Arkansas Act 1220 of 2003 is associated with a number of changes in school environments and policies, resulting from both statewide and local initiatives spawned by the Act.},

abstract = {A subject-specific step counting method with a high accuracy level at all walking speeds is needed to assess the functional level of impaired patients. The study aim was to validate step counts and cadence calculations from acceleration data by comparison to video data during dynamic activity. Custom-built activity monitors, each containing one tri-axial accelerometer, were placed on the ankles, thigh, and waist of 11 healthy adults. ICC values were greater than 0.98 for video inter-rater reliability of all step counts. The activity monitoring system (AMS) algorithm demonstrated a median (interquartile range; IQR) agreement of 92{\%} (8{\%}) with visual observations during walking/jogging trials at gait velocities ranging from 0.1 to 4.8m/s, while FitBits (ankle and waist), and a Nike Fuelband (wrist) demonstrated agreements of 92{\%} (36{\%}), 93{\%} (22{\%}), and 33{\%} (35{\%}), respectively. The algorithm results demonstrated high median (IQR) step detection sensitivity (95{\%} (2{\%})), positive predictive value (PPV) (99{\%} (1{\%})), and agreement (97{\%} (3{\%})) during a laboratory-based simulated free-living protocol. The algorithm also showed high median (IQR) sensitivity, PPV, and agreement identifying walking steps (91{\%} (5{\%}), 98{\%} (4{\%}), and 96{\%} (5{\%})), jogging steps (97{\%} (6{\%}), 100{\%} (1{\%}), and 95{\%} (6{\%})), and less than 3{\%} mean error in cadence calculations.},

abstract = {Aims This study investigated whether sedentary behaviour and different activity levels have an independent association with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and with the 3-year IMT progression in different carotid segments. Methods and results The study population included 614 healthy men and women (mean age = 44 +/- 8 years) without carotid atherosclerosis and without increased coronary heart disease risk, who underwent B-mode carotid ultrasound and objective physical activity assessment by accelerometer (mean monitoring time = 5.7 +/- 1.5 days). Time spent in sedentary (57.6 +/- 9.1{\%}), light (41.0 +/- 9.2{\%}), moderate and vigorous activities was determined. Sedentary behaviour was expressed as the ratio of time spent in sedentary and light activity (sedentary/light ratio) as these two activities occupied the majority of waking time. In 495 subjects, the carotid ultrasound was repeated 3 years after the baseline examination. After adjustment for age and the established risk factors that were independent determinants of carotid wall thickness in our population, sedentary/light ratio was independently associated only with the common carotid artery (CCA) IMT. The 3-year increase in CCA IMT was significantly lower in subjects with periods of vigorous activity (7 +/- 40 microm) when compared with those with light activity only or with periods of moderate activity (22 +/- 51 and 19 +/- 46 microm, respectively, P < 0.05). Conclusion The healthy, young-to-middle age population of this study spent more than half of their waking time in sedentary activities. The proportion of time spent in sedentary activities was directly associated with baseline CCA IMT, independently of age and established atherosclerotic risk factors. In the longitudinal analysis, period of vigorous activity influenced the 3-year IMT progression in CCA.},

Materiality concerns properties of a technology that transcend space, time, and particularities of the contexts. Our objective, in particular, is to examine how digital and physical properties may play a role in shaping user's perception and actions around the use of Fit bit devices. The primary findings are (1) both digital and physical material properties of the device together provide a material framework, which constrains and enables users' activities, and (2) both forms of materiality are contingent upon the design/form of the device. As a result the materiality of digital information cannot be studied without examining its entwining with the information technology that records, processes, shares, and represents it.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear to what extent factors affecting energy balance contribute to the development of body fatness in youth. The objective of the current study was to describe the relationship of physical activity, energy intake, and sedentary behavior to BMI, fat free-mass index (FFMI), and fat mass index (FMI) in children aged 10-18 years. METHODS: In the subsample studied, participants were 245 girls and 227 boys (aged > or =10 years at entry or during follow-up assessments, or aged 11-14 years at entry) followed for 4 years from entry at ages 8, 11, or 14 years. At baseline and anniversary examinations, trained interviewers used a questionnaire to assess time spent daily in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary behavior, and energy intake (kcal/day). Sexual maturation was assessed by direct observation of pubic-hair development (Tanner Stages 1-5). Triplicate recordings of height and weight were used to estimate BMI by the standard formula (kg/m(2)); bioelectric impedance was used to estimate percent body fat for calculating FFMI and FMI (kg/m(2)). Multilevel models were used to examine the association of MVPA, energy intake, and sedentary behavior with BMI, FFMI, and FMI. Data were analyzed in 2007-2008. RESULTS: Energy intake was unrelated to FMI or FFMI in models adjusted for age or sexual maturation or in any model to BMI. Sedentary behavior was unrelated to FMI in any model or to FFMI or BMI in models adjusted for age or sexual maturation. MVPA was inversely related to FMI. CONCLUSIONS: In children aged 10-18 years, MVPA was inversely associated with fat mass and with BMI. Investigations in youth of dietary intake and physical activity, including interventions to prevent or reverse overweight as represented by BMI, should address its fat and lean components and not BMI alone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of physical activity patterns can be used to identify sedentary behaviour and may facilitate interventions aimed at reducing inactivity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activPAL physical activity monitor as a measure of posture and motion in everyday activities using observational analysis as the criterion standard. METHODS: Wearing three activPAL monitors, 10 healthy participants performed a range of randomly assigned everyday tasks incorporating walking, standing and sitting. Each trial was captured on a digital camera and the recordings were synchronised with the activPAL. The time spent in different postures was visually classified and this was compared with the activPAL output. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2,1) for interdevice reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.99. Using the Bland and Altman method, the mean percentage difference between the activPAL monitor and observation for total time spent sitting was 0.19{\%} (limits of agreement -0.68{\%} to 1.06{\%}) and for total time spent upright was -0.27{\%} (limits of agreement -1.38{\%} to 0.84{\%}). The mean difference for total time spent standing was 1.4{\%} (limits of agreement -6.2{\%} to 9.1{\%}) and for total time spent walking was -2.0{\%} (limits of agreement -16.1{\%} to 12.1{\%}). A second-by-second analysis between observer and monitor found an overall agreement of 95.9{\%}. CONCLUSION: The activPAL activity monitor is a valid and reliable measure of posture and motion during everyday physical activities.},

abstract = {Background
          Knowledge of sedentary behaviour associations with health has relied mainly on television-viewing as a proxy and studies with other measures are less common. To clarify whether sedentary behaviour is associated with disease-risk, we examined associations for television-viewing and sitting at work.
        
        
          Methods
          Using the 1958 British birth cohort (n = 7660), we analysed cross-sectional associations between television-viewing and work sitting (four categories, 0–1 to ≥3 h/d) with total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, hypertension and metabolic syndrome at 45 y. We adjusted for lifestyle and socio-demographic factors and assessed mediation of associations by body mass index (BMI) and diet. We also assessed whether the sedentary indicators are related similarly to factors linked to disease-risk.
        
        
          Results
          There was a general trend of adverse socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics with higher h/d television-viewing, but trends in the opposite direction for work sitting. Television-viewing was associated with most biomarkers and associations were mediated by BMI: e.g. for each category increase in television-viewing, HDL-cholesterol in men was lower by 2.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.5{\%}, 3.2{\%}) and, in BMI and diet adjusted analyses, by 1.6{\%} (0.8{\%}, 2.4{\%}); for women, by 2.0{\%} (1.2{\%}, 2.9{\%}) and 0.9{\%} (0.1{\%}, 1.6{\%}) respectively. Few, weaker associations for work sitting were found, in men only: e.g. corresponding values for HDL-cholesterol were 1.2{\%} (0.5{\%}, 1.9{\%}) and 0.9{\%} (0.3{\%}, 1.5{\%}). Odds for metabolic syndrome were elevated by 82{\%} and 33{\%} respectively for men watching television or work sitting for ≥3 vs. 0–1 h/d.
        
        
          Conclusions
          Associations with cardiovascular disease and diabetes biomarkers in mid-adulthood differed for television-viewing and work sitting. The role of sedentary behaviour may vary by leisure and work domains or the two indicators reflect differing associations with other disease-related influences.},

MetS was defined according to adolescent criteria linked to the adult criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (> or =3 of high triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high waist circumference, high blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol). RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant covariates, the odds ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) for MetS increased in a dose-response manner (P(trend) < 0.01) across < or =1 h/day (1.00, referent), 2 h/day (1.21, 0.54-2.73), 3 h/day (2.16, 0.99-4.74), 4 h/day (1.73, 0.72-4.17) and > or =5 h/day (3.07, 1.48-6.34) screen time categories. Physical activity had a minimal impact on the relation between screen time and MetS. CONCLUSIONS: Screen time was associated with an increased likelihood of MetS in a dose-dependent manner independent of physical activity. These findings suggest that lifestyle-based public health interventions for youth should include a specific component aimed at reducing screen time.},

abstract = {To determine the effectiveness of school-based interventions that focus on changing dietary intake and physical activity levels to prevent childhood obesity. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched (January 2006 to September 2007) for controlled trials of school-based lifestyle interventions, minimum duration of 12 weeks, reporting weight outcome. Thirty-eight studies were included; 15 new studies and 23 studies included within the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence obesity guidance. One of three diet studies, five of 15 physical activity studies and nine of 20 combined diet and physical activity studies demonstrated significant and positive differences between intervention and control for body mass index. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions or diet vs. physical activity interventions. School-based physical activity interventions may help children maintain a healthy weight but the results are inconsistent and short-term. Physical activity interventions may be more successful in younger children and in girls. Studies were heterogeneous, making it difficult to generalize about what interventions are effective. The findings are inconsistent, but overall suggest that combined diet and physical activity school-based interventions may help prevent children becoming overweight in the long term. Physical activity interventions, particularly in girls in primary schools, may help to prevent these children from becoming overweight in the short term.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report time and prevalence of leisure time sedentary and active behaviors in adolescents. METHOD: Cross-sectional, stratified, random sample from schools in 14 districts in Scotland, 2002-03, using ecological momentary assessment (n=385 boys, 606 girls; mean age 14.1 years; range 12.6-16.7 years). This is a method of capturing current behavioral episodes. We used 15 min time intervals. RESULTS: Television viewing occupied the most leisure time. The five most time consuming sedentary activities occupied 228 min per weekday and 396 min per weekend day for boys, and 244 min per weekday and 400 min per weekend day for girls, with TV occupying one-third to one-half of this time. In contrast, 62 min was occupied by active transport and sports/exercise per weekday and 91 min per weekend day for boys, with 55 min per weekday and 47 min per weekend day for girls. A minority watched more than 4 h of TV per day, with more at weekends. Other main sedentary behaviors for boys were homework, playing computer/video games, and motorised transport and, for girls, homework, motorised transport, and sitting and talking. CONCLUSION: Scottish adolescents engage in a variety of sedentary and active behaviors. Research into sedentary behavior must assess multiple behaviors and not rely solely on TV viewing.},

abstract = {Many children exceed suggested screen-viewing guidelines and this is likely to be a risk factor for obesity. Understanding the predictors of screen-viewing may be the first step in designing interventions that target these behaviours, but there is lack of information on predictors among Spanish children. This study examined associations between individual, friend and family based social variables and screen-viewing behaviours, and how these associations differ by age and gender in a sample of Spanish children. Participants were 247 primary school-aged and 256 secondary school-aged children and their parents. Children reported time spent in screen-viewing and information about individual and friend and family based social variables. Body mass index was assessed and children were classified using International Obesity Task Force cut-off points. Parents reported sociodemographic characteristics and family co-viewing practices. Lower self-efficacy for reducing screen-viewing (console playing p < 0.05; overall p < 0.01), stronger sedentary group-norms (TV p < 0.001; console playing p < 0.05; overall p < 0.05) and stronger social reasons (console playing p < 0.05) were associated with higher screen-viewing. For younger children, parental screen-viewing rules appeared to be significant predictors while family co-viewing practices were significant predictors for older children. Older children (TV p < 0.001; console playing p < 0.01; overall p < 0.001) and males (TV p < 0.01; console playing p < 0.001; overall p < 0.01) were likely to spend more time screen-viewing. Individual and social factors influence children's screen-viewing and operate differently during childhood. Increasing self-efficacy may be important for screen-viewing based behaviour changes. Friends and parents play a central role, therefore understanding the dynamics of friends and targeting family influences may be critical to the success of interventions to reduce screen-viewing.},

@article{Cadmus-Bertram2015a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Direct-to-consumer trackers and devices have potential to enhance theory-based physical activity interventions by offering a simple and pleasant way to help participants self-monitor their behavior. A secondary benefit of these devices is the opportunity for investigators to objectively track adherence to physical activity goals across weeks or even months, rather than relying on self-report or a small number of accelerometry wear periods. The use of consumer trackers for continuous monitoring of adherence has considerable potential to enhance physical activity research, but few studies have been published in this rapidly developing area.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the trajectory of physical activity adherence across a 16-week self-monitoring intervention, as measured by the Fitbit tracker.

METHODS: Participants were 25 overweight or obese, postmenopausal women enrolled in the intervention arm of a randomized controlled physical activity intervention trial. Each participant received a 16-week technology-based intervention that used the Fitbit physical activity tracker and website. The overall study goal was 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and 10,000 steps/day; however, goals were set individually for each participant and updated at Week 4 based on progress. Adherence data were collected by the Fitbit and aggregated by Fitabase. Participants also wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer for 7 days prior to the intervention and again during Week 16.

RESULTS: The median participant logged 10 hours or more/day of Fitbit wear on 95{\%} of the 112 intervention days, with no significant decline in wear over the study period. Participants averaged 7540 (SD 2373) steps/day and 82 minutes/week (SD 43) of accumulated "fairly active" and "very active" minutes during the intervention. At Week 4, 80{\%} (20/25) of women chose to maintain/increase their individual MVPA goal and 72{\%} (18/25) of participants chose to maintain/increase their step goal. Physical activity levels were relatively stable after peaking at 3 weeks, with only small declines of 8{\%} for steps (P=.06) and 14{\%} for MVPA (P=.05) by 16 weeks.

CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a sophisticated, direct-to-consumer activity tracker encouraged high levels of self-monitoring that were sustained over 16 weeks. Further study is needed to determine how to motivate additional gains in physical activity and evaluate the long-term utility of the Fitbit tracker as part of a strategy for chronic disease prevention.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although several studies have identified a positive association between recreational facility availability and physical activity, few have examined facility attributes beyond availability and involved minority adolescents. This study examines how both objective and perceived measures of the facility environment are associated with urban adolescents' use of parks and physical activity. METHODS: Study participants included 329 adolescents from two high schools in Baltimore, Maryland, the majority (69{\%}) of whom was African American. A Web-based survey assessed park use, neighborhood crime, and park availability, quality, and use by friends and family. Geographical Information Systems data were used to develop objective measures of park availability and crime. Physical activity data were obtained from 316 participants using accelerometers. Hypotheses regarding environmental correlates of park use and physical activity were tested using logistic regression models (for park use) and linear regression models (for physical activity). RESULTS: Perceptions of greater park availability, quality, and use by friends were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of an adolescents' park use. Perceptions of more park availability was associated with higher levels of physical activity, although this association was marginally significant. Objective measures of park availability and objective and subjective measures of crime were not associated with either park use or physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to promote park use for physical activity among urban youth should increase awareness of park availability, improve perceptions of park quality, and utilize social networks.},

abstract = {Hypothesis:Physically active occupations may protect against the risk of abdominal obesity.Objectives:This study assessed the interaction between non-occupational physical activity (NOA) (leisure-time, transport and domestic activity) and occupational activity (OA) in relation to abdominal obesity.Methods:A total of 3539 adults over the age of 20, with no work limitations, employed in one of the 17 occupations classified as low OA (LOA) or high OA (HOA) were identified in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Waist circumference (WC) was used to categorize individuals into either non-obese or abdominally obese (WC>88 cm in women and >102 cm in men) categories. NOA was divided into three categories based upon physical activity guidelines: (1) no NOA; (2) insufficient NOA; and (3) sufficient NOA. Logistic regression was used to examine possible associations between NOA, OA and abdominal obesity.Results:In those who are sedentary outside of work, a high-activity occupation reduces the odds risk ratio of being categorized with abdominal obesity to 0.37 in comparison with those who work in low-activity occupations. For people working in low-activity occupations, there was a clear association with activity outside of work and the odds risk ratio of being categorized with abdominal obesity. In these adults, a reduced odds ratio was found only among those who met the physical activity guidelines through NOA (odds ratio=0.55; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=0.40-0.75).Conclusion:HOA is associated with a reduced risk of abdominal obesity. Thus, it is important to include OA in studies seeking to understand the association between physical activity and abdominal adiposity.International Journal of Obesity advance online publication, 22 March 2011; doi:10.1038/ijo.2011.50.},

As the novelty of weight loss treatment fades, enthusiasm for diet and exercise tends to wane in the maintenance phase. Given the recognition of obesity as a chronic disorder requiring continued engagement in weight-control behaviors, there is a need to identify cost-effective and supportive therapies that can sustain motivation. In this paper, we describe the study design and baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in a trial to evaluate a program (Keep It Off) developed specifically for weight-loss maintenance using therapeutic phone contact with recent weight losers throughout the period in which they are at highest risk for weight regain. In the Keep It Off randomized clinical trial we are evaluating this phone-based intervention that focuses on key weight-loss maintenance behaviors followed by continued self-monitoring, reporting of weight, feedback, and outreach in members of a Minnesota managed-care organization. The goal of the intervention is to flatten the typical relapse curve. Moreover, data from this trial will inform our understanding of weight-loss maintenance, including predictors and behaviors that increase the likelihood of success over the long term.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the number of deaths caused by risk factors is needed for health policy and priority setting. Our aim was to estimate the mortality effects of the following 12 modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors in the United States (US) using consistent and comparable methods: high blood glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and blood pressure; overweight-obesity; high dietary trans fatty acids and salt; low dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids (seafood), and fruits and vegetables; physical inactivity; alcohol use; and tobacco smoking. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used data on risk factor exposures in the US population from nationally representative health surveys and disease-specific mortality statistics from the National Center for Health Statistics. We obtained the etiological effects of risk factors on disease-specific mortality, by age, from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiological studies that had adjusted (i) for major potential confounders, and (ii) where possible for regression dilution bias. We estimated the number of disease-specific deaths attributable to all non-optimal levels of each risk factor exposure, by age and sex. In 2005, tobacco smoking and high blood pressure were responsible for an estimated 467,000 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 436,000-500,000) and 395,000 (372,000-414,000) deaths, accounting for about one in five or six deaths in US adults. Overweight-obesity (216,000; 188,000-237,000) and physical inactivity (191,000; 164,000-222,000) were each responsible for nearly 1 in 10 deaths. High dietary salt (102,000; 97,000-107,000), low dietary omega-3 fatty acids (84,000; 72,000-96,000), and high dietary trans fatty acids (82,000; 63,000-97,000) were the dietary risks with the largest mortality effects. Although 26,000 (23,000-40,000) deaths from ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and diabetes were averted by current alcohol use, they were outweighed by 90,000 (88,000-94,000) deaths from other cardiovascular diseases, cancers, liver cirrhosis, pancreatitis, alcohol use disorders, road traffic and other injuries, and violence. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking and high blood pressure, which both have effective interventions, are responsible for the largest number of deaths in the US. Other dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors for chronic diseases also cause a substantial number of deaths in the US.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated a neighborhood environment survey and compared the physical activity and weight status of the residents in 2 neighborhoods. METHODS: On 2 occasions, 107 adults from neighborhoods with differing "walkability" were selected to complete a survey on their neighborhood environment. Physical activity was assessed by self-report and by accelerometer; height and weight were assessed by self-report. RESULTS: Neighborhood environment characteristics had moderate to high test-retest reliabilities. Residents of high-walkability neighborhoods reported higher residential density, land use mix, street connectivity, aesthetics, and safety. They had more than 70 more minutes of physical activity and had lower obesity prevalence (adjusted for individual demographics) than did residents of low-walkability neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: The reliability and validity of self-reported neighborhood environment subscales were supported. Neighborhood environment was associated with physical activity and overweight prevalence.},

Given the complex task of accomplishing long-term behavioural change, developers have started to incorporate game elements into their apps as motivational tools and to increase user engagement. However, with increasing number of health-related apps available on mobile platforms every day, several issues have started to arise. In this paper, we critically review the health app landscape from several perspectives. We underline the current lack of scientific theory usage in app development, inefficient and selective embedding of gamification, low levels of personalization and potential privacy and trust issues in this domain. Given the multi-disciplinary nature of this set of problems, we propose integrated and user-centred frameworks as one potential solution direction to resolve problems both users and app-developers are facing today.},

abstract = {A weight-height index of adiposity should indicate the relative fatness of subjects of differing height unless obesity is itself correlated with height. The average body fat among adult women attending a hospital outpatient clinic for obesity was 40.5 percent of body weight. The height of an unselected series of 286 of these outpatients was found to be similar to that of the general population of women of similar age, which indicates that obesity in adult women is not significantly related to height. Body composition was measured by body density, body water and body potassium in a series of 104 female and 24 male subjects aged 14-60 years. In both sexes density, water and potassium gave progressively higher estimates of body fat (kg), and there was a significant difference between the values by different methods. The average of the estimates by these three methods was taken to be the 'true' value for each individual (F kg). Regression of F/H2 on W/H2 (Quetelet's index) gave a correlation coefficient of 0.955 for women and 0.943 for men. The deviation of the body fat estimated from Quetelet's formula from the 'true' value was not much greater than that when density, water or potassium were used as a basis for estimating body fat. It is concluded that Quetelet's formula is both a convenient and reliable indicator of obesity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Examine whether cardiometabolic risk factors are predicted by fitness or fatness among adolescents. METHODS: Participants are 4955 (2614 female) sixth-grade students with complete data from 42 US middle schools. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and insulin concentrations. Waist circumference and blood pressure were assessed. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as normal weight, overweight, or obese as a measure of fatness. Fitness was assessed using the multistage shuttle test and was converted into gender-specific quintiles. Gender-specific regression models, adjusted for race, pubertal status, and household education, were run to identify whether BMI group predicted risk factors. Models were repeated with fitness group and both fitness and fatness groups as predictors. RESULTS: Means for each risk factor (except HDL, which was the reverse) were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) with increased fatness and differed across all BMI groups (P < 0.001). Waist circumference, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, diastolic blood pressure, and insulin were inversely associated with fitness (P < 0.001). When both fatness and fitness were included in the model, BMI was associated (P < 0.001) with almost all cardiometabolic risk factors; fitness was only associated with waist circumference (both genders), LDL-cholesterol (males), and insulin (both genders). Other associations between fitness and cardiometabolic risk factors were attenuated after adjustment for BMI group. CONCLUSIONS: Both fatness and fitness are associated with cardiometabolic risk factors among sixth-grade youth, but stronger associations were observed for fatness. Although maintaining high levels of fitness and preventing obesity may positively affect cardiometabolic risk factors, greater benefit may be obtained from obesity prevention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined the covarying patterns of physical activity and sedentary behaviors among adolescents and their long-term maintenance. METHODS: Data came from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995-2002). We used latent class analysis to identify distinct covarying patterns in adolescence. Logistic regression models were used to predict odds of meeting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendations (> or = 5 bouts/week) and exceeding screen time guidelines (> 2 hours/day) 6 years later based on their adolescent class profile. RESULTS: Five classes for each gender were identified and labeled as low physical activity (PA)/low sedentary behaviors (SED), moderate (Mod) PA/high (HI) SED, Mod PA/low SED, HI PA/low SED, and HI PA (except skating/biking)/low SED. Compared with low PA/low SED, males and females in Mod PA/low SED, HI PA/low SED, and HI PA (except skating/biking)/low SED classes had increased odds of meeting MVPA recommendations in young adulthood. Mod PA/HI SED had higher odds of exceeding screen time guidelines in young adulthood (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for females: 1.67, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-2.81; AOR for males: 3.31, 95{\%} CI: 1.80-6.09). CONCLUSIONS: Findings are useful to aid the development of multifactorial interventions that promote physical activity and reduce screen time among adolescents transitioning to adulthood.},

This theory posits a multifaceted causal structure in which self-efficacy beliefs operate together with goals, outcome expectations, and perceived environmental impediments and facilitators in the regulation of human motivation, behavior, and well-being. Belief in one's efficacy to exercise control is a common pathway through which psychosocial influences affect health functioning. This core belief affects each of the basic processes of personal change--whether people even consider changing their health habits, whether they mobilize the motivation and perseverance needed to succeed should they do so, their ability to recover from setbacks and relapses, and how well they maintain the habit changes they have achieved. Human health is a social matter, not just an individual one. A comprehensive approach to health promotion also requires changing the practices of social systems that have widespread effects on human health.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Physically active classroom lessons have been found to increase on-task behavior in children. Given that physical activity has been associated with an increased time on task (TOT) and that overweight children take fewer steps than normal weight children do, it was expected that benefits of the physical activity would differentially impact those children of higher weight status. PURPOSE:: To examine the effects of a physically active classroom lesson and body mass index (BMI) category on TOT in a sample of elementary-aged children (N = 97). METHODS:: Behavior was assessed through direct observations before and after a physically active classroom lesson and before and after a traditional inactive classroom lesson. TOT was calculated through momentary time sampling for each student by dividing the number of on-task observations by the total number of observations per student (interrater reliability = 94{\%}). RESULTS:: TOT decreased significantly from before to after the lesson for all BMI categories in the inactive control condition, with no change for the active condition. Post hoc analyses found a significant linear effect for the reduction in TOT with each level of BMI in the inactive condition, with the greatest magnitude of effect for the overweight group. CONCLUSIONS:: Physically active classroom lessons provide a buffer to prevent the steep reduction in TOT experienced after a period of inactivity in all children, especially those who are overweight.},

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of aerobic training and type 2 diabetes on intramyocellular localization of lipids, mitochondria, and glycogen. Obese type 2 diabetic patients (n = 12) and matched obese controls (n = 12) participated in aerobic cycling training for 10 wk. Endurance-trained athletes (n = 15) were included for comparison. Insulin action was determined by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Intramyocellular contents of lipids, mitochondria, and glycogen at different subcellular compartments were assessed by transmission electron microscopy in biopsies obtained from vastus lateralis muscle. Type 2 diabetic patients were more insulin resistant than obese controls and had threefold higher volume of subsarcolemmal (SS) lipids compared with obese controls and endurance-trained subjects. No difference was found in intermyofibrillar lipids. Importantly, following aerobic training, this excess SS lipid volume was lowered by approximately 50{\%}, approaching the levels observed in the nondiabetic subjects. A strong inverse association between insulin sensitivity and SS lipid volume was found (r(2)=0.62, P = 0.002). The volume density and localization of mitochondria and glycogen were the same in type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects, and showed in parallel with improved insulin sensitivity a similar increase in response to training, however, with a more pronounced increase in SS mitochondria and SS glycogen than in other localizations. In conclusion, this study, estimating intramyocellular localization of lipids, mitochondria, and glycogen, indicates that type 2 diabetic patients may be exposed to increased levels of SS lipids. Thus consideration of cell compartmentation may advance the understanding of the role of lipids in muscle function and type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of the Fitbit wireless activity tracker in assessing energy expenditure (EE) for different activities.

METHODS: Twenty participants (10 males, 10 females) wore the Fitbit Classic wireless activity tracker on the hip and the Oxycon Mobile portable metabolic system (criterion). Participants performed walking and running trials on a treadmill and a simulated free-living activity routine. Paired t tests were used to test for differences between estimated (Fitbit) and criterion (Oxycon) kcals for each of the activities.

RESULTS: Mean bias for estimated energy expenditure for all activities was -4.5 ± 1.0 kcals/6 min (95{\%} limits of agreement: -25.2 to 15.8 kcals/6 min). The Fitbit significantly underestimated EE for cycling, laundry, raking, treadmill (TM) 3 mph at 5{\%} grade, ascent/descent stairs, and TM 4 mph at 5{\%} grade, and significantly overestimated EE for carrying groceries. Energy expenditure estimated by the Fitbit was not significantly different than EE calculated from the Oxycon Mobile for 9 activities.

CONCLUSION: The Fitbit worn on the hip significantly underestimates EE of activities. The variability in underestimation of EE for the different activities may be problematic for weight loss management applications since accurate EE estimates are important for tracking/monitoring energy deficit.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a multicomponent health promotion intervention for Dutch adolescents (defined as persons between 12 and 14 years of age) would be successful in influencing body composition and dietary and physical activity behavior in both the short and long terms. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Ten intervention and 8 control prevocational secondary schools. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1108 adolescents (mean age, 12.7 years). Intervention An interdisciplinary program with an adapted curriculum for 11 lessons in biology and physical education and environmental change options. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body height and weight, waist circumference, 4 skinfold thickness measurements, and dietary and physical activity behavior data. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses showed that the intervention remained effective in preventing unfavorable increases in important measures of body composition after 20-month follow-up in girls (biceps skinfold and sum of 4 skinfolds) and boys (triceps, biceps, and subscapular skinfolds). Consumption of sugar-containing beverages was significantly lower in intervention schools both after intervention (boys: -287 mL/d; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -527 to -47; girls: -249; -400 to -98) and at 12-month follow-up (boys: -233; -371 to -95; girls: -271; -390 to -153). For boys, screen-viewing behavior was significantly lower in the intervention group after 20 months (-25 min/d; 95{\%} CI, -50 to -0.3). No significant intervention effects on consumption of snacks or active commuting to school were found. CONCLUSION: The Dutch Obesity Intervention in Teenagers program resulted in beneficial effects on the sum of skinfold thickness measurements in girls and consumption of sugar-containing beverages in both boys and girls in both the short and long terms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mobile applications (apps) for physical activity are popular and hold promise for promoting behavior change and reducing non-communicable disease risk. App marketing materials describe a limited number of behavior change techniques (BCTs), but apps may include unmarketed BCTs, which are important as well.

PURPOSE: To characterize the extent to which BCTs have been implemented in apps from a systematic user inspection of apps.

METHODS: Top-ranked physical activity apps (N=100) were identified in November 2013 and analyzed in 2014. BCTs were coded using a contemporary taxonomy following a user inspection of apps.

RESULTS: Users identified an average of 6.6 BCTs per app and most BCTs in the taxonomy were not represented in any apps. The most common BCTs involved providing social support, information about others' approval, instructions on how to perform a behavior, demonstrations of the behavior, and feedback on the behavior. A latent class analysis of BCT configurations revealed that apps focused on providing support and feedback as well as support and education.

CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary physical activity apps have implemented a limited number of BCTs and have favored BCTs with a modest evidence base over others with more established evidence of efficacy (e.g., social media integration for providing social support versus active self-monitoring by users). Social support is a ubiquitous feature of contemporary physical activity apps and differences between apps lie primarily in whether the limited BCTs provide education or feedback about physical activity.},

@article{Tudor-Locke2012,
abstract = {The health benefits of a physically active lifestyle across a person's lifespan have been established. If there is any single physical activity behaviour that we should measure well and promote effectively, it is ambulatory activity and, more specifically, walking. Since public health physical activity guidelines include statements related to intensity of activity, it follows that we need to measure and promote free-living patterns of ambulatory activity that are congruent with this intent. The purpose of this review article is to present and summarize the potential for using cadence (steps/minute) to represent such behavioural patterns of ambulatory activity in free-living. Cadence is one of the spatio-temporal parameters of gait or walking speed. It is typically assessed using short-distance walks in clinical research and practice, but free-living cadence can be captured with a number of commercially available accelerometers that possess time-stamping technology. This presents a unique opportunity to use the same metric to communicate both ambulatory performance (assessed under testing conditions) and behaviour (assessed in the real world). Ranges for normal walking cadence assessed under laboratory conditions are 96-138 steps/minute for women and 81-135 steps/minute for men across their lifespan. The correlation between mean cadence and intensity (assessed with indirect calorimetry and expressed as metabolic equivalents [METs]) based on five treadmill/overground walking studies, is r = 0.93 and 100 steps/minute is considered to be a reasonable heuristic value indicative of walking at least at absolutely-defined moderate intensity (i.e. minimally, 3 METs) in adults. The weighted mean cadence derived from eight studies that have observed pedestrian cadence under natural conditions was 115.2 steps/minute, demonstrating that achieving 100 steps/minute is realistic in specific settings that occur in real life. However, accelerometer data collected in a large, representative sample suggest that self-selected walking at a cadence equivalent to ≥100 steps/minute is a rare occurrence in free-living adults. Specifically, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data show that US adults spent ≅4.8 hours/day in non-movement (i.e. zero cadence) during wearing time, ≅8.7 hours at 1-59 steps/minute, ≅16 minutes/day at cadences of 60-79 steps/minute, ≅8 minutes at 80-99 steps/minute, ≅5 minutes at 100-119 steps/minute, and ≅2 minutes at 120+ steps/minute. Cadence appears to be sensitive to change with intervention, and capitalizing on the natural tempo of music is an obvious means of targeting cadence. Cadence could potentially be used effectively in epidemiological study, intervention and behavioural research, dose-response studies, determinants studies and in prescription and practice. It is easily interpretable by researchers, clinicians, programme staff and the lay public, and therefore offers the potential to bridge science, practice and real life.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined physical activity opportunities and barriers at 36 geographically diverse middle schools participating in the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls. METHODS: Principals, physical education and health education department heads, and program leaders were interviewed to assess policies and instructional practices that support physical activity. RESULTS: Schools provided approximately 110 hours per year in physical education instruction. Approximately 20{\%} of students walked or bicycled to school. Eighty-three percent of schools offered interscholastic sports and 69{\%} offered intramural sports. Most schools offered programs for girls, but on average, only 24 girls ( approximately 5{\%}) in the schools attended any programs. Only 25{\%} of schools allowed after school free play. An overall score created to assess school environmental support for physical activity indicated that, on average, schools met 6.7 items of 10 items. Free/reduced lunch program participation versus not (p = .04), perceived priority of physical education instruction over coaching (p = .02), and safety for walking/bicycling to school (p = .02) predicted environmental support score. CONCLUSIONS: Schools have policies and practices that support physical activity, although unfavorable practices exist. Schools must work with community partners and officials to provide environments that optimally support physical activity, especially schools that serve low-income students.},

The program's impact on leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and on physical activity enjoyment (PAE) is also presented. The 16-week program, named FunAction, utilizes social marketing principles. Control (n = 90) and intervention (n = 131) students are assessed pre- and postintervention for levels of LTPA and PAE. Results indicate that although the program did not contribute to an increase in LTPA or PAE among intervention group students, participation in the program was elevated. This study offers preliminary evidence that noncurricular physical activity promotion programs that apply social marketing principles can be effective in engaging multiethnic, underserved adolescents in physical activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe and explore the effects of contextual and behaviour change technique (BCT) content of control and target interventions in clinical trials.

DESIGN: Review and meta-analysis of 42 trials from a Cochrane review of physical activity in chronic musculoskeletal pain.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Two researchers coded descriptions of target and control interventions for (a) 93 BCTs and (b) whether target and control interventions shared each of five contextual features (practitioners' characteristics, patient-practitioner relationship, intervention credibility, superficial treatment characteristics e.g. delivery modality, and environment). Quality of study reporting was assessed. Effect sizes for adherence to physical activity and class attendance were computed (Cohen's d) and analysed separately.

RESULTS: For physical activity outcomes, after controlling for reporting quality, larger effect sizes were associated with target and control interventions using different modalities ($\beta$ = -.34, p = .030), target and control interventions involving equivalent patient-practitioner relationship ($\beta$ = .40, p = .002), and target interventions having more unique BCTs (i.e. more BCTs not also in the control) ($\beta$ = .008, p = .030). There were no significant effect moderators for class attendance outcomes.

CONCLUSION: Contents of control conditions can influence effect sizes and should be considered carefully in trial design and systematic reviews.},

This study considered the prevalence of different aspects of physical activity and sedentary behavior in 11-16-y-olds based on a representative national survey of 3270 Icelandic primary schoolchildren (91{\%} response rate). All-day sedentary behavior was extremely rare 1{\%}), and the vast majority (91{\%}) were physically active or = 3 times per week) during school or leisure time, thanks largely to school physical education. Only 39{\%} were physically active or = 3 times per week) during leisure time, and only 29{\%} engaged in regular or = 3 times per week) leisure time strenuous exercise. Girls were more sedentary, less leisure time physically active, and less involved in leisure time strenuous exercise. Sedentary behavior increased and physically active behavior decreased with age, especially after early adolescence. However, there were no age differences in strenuous leisure time exercise. Upper-class students were less sedentary and more physically active during leisure time than working-class students. Finally, rural students were more sedentary during leisure time, and less physically active than students from urban areas. An interaction was found between age and residence when predicting leisure time physical activity, indicating that the inverse age-activity relationship in urban areas is partly reversed in rural areas. Conclusion: Compulsory school physical education frequently failed to translate into voluntary physical involvement. Sociodemographic differences in physical activity were greater during leisure time, than during school and leisure time combined.},

abstract = {Various innovative chemical sensors have been developed in recent years to sense dangerous substances in air and trace biomarkers in breath. However, in order to solve real world problems, the sensors must be equipped with efficient sample conditioning that can, e.g., control the humidity, which is discussed much less in the literature. To meet the demand, a miniaturized mouthpiece was developed for personal breath analyzers. A key function of the mouthpiece is to condition the humidity in real breath samples without changing the analyte concentrations and introducing substantial backpressure, which is achieved with optimized packing of desiccant particles. Numerical simulations were carried out to determine the performance of the mouthpiece in terms of various controllable parameters, such as the size, density, and geometry of the packing. Mouthpieces with different configurations were built and tested, and the experimental data validated the simulation findings. A mouthpiece with optimized performance reducing relative humidity from 95{\%} (27,000 ppmV) to 29{\%} (8000 ppmV) whereas retaining 92{\%} nitric oxide (50 ppbV to 46 ppbV) was built and integrated into a hand-held exhaled nitric oxide sensor, and the performance of exhaled nitric oxide measurement was in good agreement with the gold standard chemiluminescence technique. Acetone, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and ammonia samples were also measured after passing through the desiccant mouthpiece using commercial sensors to examine wide applicability of this breath conditioning approach.},

The increase in available technology is thought to be a contributor in the obesogenic environment, yet at the same time technology can also be used to intervene and improve health and health behaviors. This article reviews the components of effective weight management programs and the novel role that technology, such as SMS, websites, and smartphone apps, is playing to improve the success of such programs. Use of these modern technologies can now allow for individualized treatment recommendations to be delivered to individuals remotely, increased self-monitoring/tracking of health-related data, broader and more rapid dissemination of health information/recommendations, and increased patient-dietician/physician contact. The use of technology in weight management programs results in improved long-term weight management, and in most cases improved cost-effectiveness. Rather than blaming increased food intake and sedentary lifestyle on technology, rapidly developing and innovative technologies should be used to our advantage and deployed to combat the obesity epidemic.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was twofold: 1) to evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based physical activity intervention, Action Schools! BC (AS! BC), for maintaining academic performance in a multiethnic group of elementary children, and 2) to determine whether boys and girls' academic performance changed similarly after participation in AS! BC. METHODS: This was a 16-month cluster randomized controlled trial. Ten schools were randomized to intervention (INT) or usual practice (UP). One INT school administered the wrong final test, and one UP school graded their own test, so both were excluded. Thus, eight schools (six INT, two UP) were included in the final analysis. Children (143 boys, 144 girls) in grades 4 and 5 were recruited for the study. We used the Canadian Achievement Test (CAT-3) to evaluate academic performance (TotScore). Weekly teacher activity logs determined amounts of physical activity delivered by teachers to students. Physical activity was determined with the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C). Independent t-tests compared descriptive variables between groups and between boys and girls. We used a mixed linear model to evaluate differences in TotScore at follow-up between groups and between girls and boys. RESULTS: Physical activity delivered by teachers to children in INT schools was increased by 47 min x wk(-1) (139 +/- 62 vs 92 +/- 45, P < 0.001). Participants attending UP schools had significantly higher baseline TotScores than those attending INT schools. Despite this, there was no significant difference in TotScore between groups at follow-up and between boys and girls at baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSION: The AS! BC model is an attractive and feasible intervention to increase physical activity for students while maintaining levels of academic performance.},

The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the evidence of the effectiveness of interventions that report physical activity outcomes in children aged 4-12 years and adolescents aged 13-19 years. A systematic search of electronic databases identified 76 interventions. Most interventions were delivered via the school setting (57 interventions), nine through the family setting, six via primary care, and four in community- or Internet-based settings. Children's physical activity interventions that were most effective in the school setting included some focus on physical education, activity breaks, and family strategies. Interventions delivered in the family setting were not highly effective, but many were pilot studies. The use of motivationally tailored strategies and program delivery in the primary care setting showed promise among adolescents. Many studies had methodological and reporting flaws (e.g., no baseline data, poor study design, physical activity measures of unknown reliability and validity, and poor reporting of sample size, response rates, attrition/retention, compliance, year of intervention, and duration of intervention). Publications reporting the results of evaluations of intervention studies should follow the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines or, for nonrandomized studies, should follow the Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Nonrandomized Designs guidelines. Further evidence of the effectiveness of interventions promoting young people's physical activity in family and community settings is needed.},

abstract = {Formative research is used to inform intervention development, but the processes of transmitting results to intervention planners and incorporating information into intervention designs are not well documented. The authors describe how formative research results from the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG) were transferred to planners to guide intervention development. Methods included providing oral and written reports, prioritizing recommendations, and cross-checking recommendations with intervention objectives and implementation strategies. Formative work influenced the intervention in many ways. For example, results indicated that middle schools offered only coeducational physical education and health education classes, so the TAAG intervention was designed to be appropriate for both sexes, and intervention strategies were developed to directly address girls' stated preferences (e.g., enjoyable activities, opportunity to socialize) and barriers (e.g., lack of skills, fear of injury) for physical activity. The challenges of using formative research for intervention development are discussed.},

@article{Thorp2010,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of sitting time and television (TV) viewing time with continuously measured biomarkers of cardio-metabolic risk in Australian adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Waist circumference, BMI, resting blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, fasting and 2-h postload plasma glucose, and fasting insulin were measured in 2,761 women and 2,103 men aged > or =30 years (mean age 54 years) without clinically diagnosed diabetes from the 2004-2005 Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study. Multivariate linear regression analyses examined associations of self-reported sitting time and TV viewing time (hours per day) with these biomarkers, adjusting for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: For both women and men, sitting time was detrimentally associated with waist circumference, BMI, systolic blood pressure, fasting triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, 2-h postload plasma glucose, and fasting insulin (all P < 0.05), but not with fasting plasma glucose and diastolic blood pressure (men only). With the exception of HDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure in women, the associations remained significant after further adjustment for waist circumference. TV viewing time was detrimentally associated with all metabolic measures in women and all except HDL cholesterol and blood pressure in men. Only fasting insulin and glucose (men only) remained deleteriously associated with TV viewing time after adjustment for waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: In women and men, sitting time and TV viewing time were deleteriously associated with cardio-metabolic risk biomarkers, with sitting time having more consistent associations in both sexes and being independent of central adiposity. Preventive initiatives aimed at reducing sitting time should focus on both nonleisure and leisure-time domains.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effectiveness of workplace interventions for reducing sitting. METHODS: Studies published up to April 2009 were identified by literature searches in multiple databases. Studies were included if they were interventions to increase energy expenditure (increase physical activity or decrease sitting); were conducted in a workplace setting; and specifically measured sitting as a primary or secondary outcome. Two independent reviewers assessed methodological quality of the included studies, and data on study design, sample, measures of sitting, intervention and results were extracted. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria (five randomised trials and one pre-post study). The primary aim of all six was to increase physical activity; all had reducing sitting as a secondary aim. All used self-report measures of sitting; one specifically assessed occupational sitting time; the others used measures of general sitting. No studies showed that sitting decreased significantly in the intervention group, compared with a control or comparison group. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is a dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of workplace interventions for reducing sitting. In light of the growing body of evidence that prolonged sitting is negatively associated with health, this highlights a gap in the scientific literature that needs to be addressed.},

abstract = {Recent developments in our ability to capture, curate, and analyze data, the field of data-intensive science (DIS), have indeed made these interesting and challenging times for scientific practice as well as policy making in real time. We are confronted with immense datasets that challenge our ability to pool, transfer, analyze, or interpret scientific observations. We have more data available than ever before, yet more questions to be answered as well, and no clear path to answer them. We are excited by the potential for science-based solutions to humankind's problems, yet stymied by the limitations of our current cyberinfrastructure and existing public policies. Importantly, DIS signals a transformation of the hypothesis-driven tradition of science ("first hypothesize, then experiment") to one that is typified by "first experiment, then hypothesize" mode of discovery. Another hallmark of DIS is that it amasses data that are public goods (i.e., creates a "commons") that can further be creatively mined for various applications in different sectors. As such, this calls for a science policy vision that is long term. We herein reflect on how best to approach to policy making at this critical inflection point when DIS applications are being diversified in agriculture, ecology, marine biology, and environmental research internationally. This article outlines the key policy issues and gaps that emerged from the multidisciplinary discussions at the NSF-funded DIS workshop held at the Seattle Children's Research Institute in Seattle, on September 19-20, 2010.},

abstract = {The population statistics of most countries of the world are indicating that industrialization and computerization have been associated with an increase in sedentariness and more recently with a significant shift from healthy weight to overweight. In general, this change in the overweight/obesity prevalence is attributed by health professionals to suboptimal diet and physical activity practices. However, recent data raised the possibility that excess weight gain might also be the outcome of changes imposed by our '24-hour', hectic lifestyle. Parallel to an increase in body weight, one has observed a reduction in sleep time and an increase in knowledge-based work (KBW) that appear as a growing necessity in a context of economic competitiveness and globalization. Sleep and cognitive work both exert a trivial effect on energy expenditure and may thus be considered as sedentary activities. However, their respective effect on energy intake is opposite. Indeed, an increase in the practice of the most sedentary activity, i.e. sleep, is associated with a hormonal profile facilitating appetite control whereas KBW appears as a stimulus favoring a significant enhancing effect on food intake. Television viewing is another example of sedentary activity that has been shown to increase the intake of high-density foods. These observations demonstrate that the modern way of living has favored a change in human activities whose impact goes well beyond what has traditionally been attributed to a lack of physical exercise. Therefore, we will need to reconsider the notion of 'sedentariness' which includes several activities having opposing effects on energy balance.},

METHODS: Junior high school students (n=113) enrolled in seventh- and eighth-grade physical education classes (52 girls, 61 boys) volunteered to participate in a 5-week study to assess daily step counts. Ten physical education classes were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (a) self-regulation, (b) open, and (c) control. RESULTS: A repeated-measures, mixed-model analysis of variance revealed a significant 3x4 (Group by Time) interaction effect, F6,290=2.64, P<.02. Follow-up analyses indicated participants in the self-regulation group took 2071 to 4141 more steps/d than the control. No other significant differences emerged among groups on step counts. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that having access to and charting daily step counts (ie, self-regulatory strategies) positively influenced young adolescents to attain a higher number of steps/d.},

abstract = {Obesity prevalence is nearly double among individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), including schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, compared with the general population. Emerging mobile health (m-health) technologies are increasingly available and offer the potential to support lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss, yet the practical feasibility of using these technologies in this high-risk group has not been established. We evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among overweight and obese individuals with SMI. We provided wearable activity monitoring devices (FitBit [San Francisco, CA] Zip™ or Nike Inc. [Beaverton, OR] FuelBand) and smartphones (Apple [Cupertino, CA] iPhone(®) 4S) for accessing the smartphone application for each device to participants with SMI enrolled in a weight loss program. Feasibility of these devices was measured by the frequency of use over time. Acceptability was measured through qualitative follow-up interviews with participants. Ten participants with SMI wore the devices for a mean of 89{\%} (standard deviation=13{\%}) of the days in the study. Five participants wore the devices 100{\%} of the time. Participants reported high satisfaction, stating the devices were easy to use, helpful for setting goals, motivational, and useful for self-monitoring. Several participants liked the social connectivity feature of the devices where they could see each other's progress on the smartphone application, noting that "friendly" competition increased motivation to be more physically active. This study supports using popular m-health technologies for activity tracking among individuals with SMI. These findings can inform the design of weight loss interventions targeting this vulnerable patient population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity and physical inactivity are poor prognostic indicators for breast cancer. Studies to date have relied on self-report measures of physical activity, which tend mainly to assess moderate-to-vigorous intensity leisure-time physical activity. We report the cross-sectional associations of objectively assessed physical activity and sedentary time with adiposity in a sample of breast cancer survivors from the United States. METHODS: One hundred and eleven women from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 reported a history of breast cancer. Participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days, and activity levels were summarized as moderate-to-vigorous intensity (accelerometer counts/min > or =1,952), light intensity (counts/min 100-1,951), and sedentary time (counts/min <100). Anthropometric measures were taken by study staff at examination centers. RESULTS: Participants spent the majority of their day in sedentary time (66{\%}) or in light intensity activities (33{\%}). Log moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was negatively associated with adiposity (waist circumference beta = -9.805 [95{\%} CI: -15.836, -3.775]; BMI beta = -3.576 [95{\%} CI: -6.687, -0.464]). Light intensity physical activity was negatively associated with adiposity; however, the fully adjusted models did not retain statistical significance. Similarly, sedentary time was positively associated with adiposity, but the fully adjusted models were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the objectively assessed physical activity and sedentary time of breast cancer survivors. Increasing moderate-to-vigorous and light intensity physical activity, and decreasing sedentary time, may assist with weight management and improve other metabolic health outcomes for breast cancer survivors.},

abstract = {Consistent with a strong hormonal etiology, endometrial cancer is thought to be influenced by both obesity and physical activity. Although obesity has been consistently related to risk, associations with physical activity have been inconclusive. We examined relationships of activity patterns with endometrial cancer incidence in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort, which included 109,621 women, ages 50-71, without cancer history, who in 1995-1996 completed a mailed baseline questionnaire capturing daily routine and vigorous (defined as any period of >or=20 min of activity at work or home causing increases in breathing, heart rate, or sweating) physical activity. A second questionnaire, completed by 70,351 women, in 1996-1997 collected additional physical activity information. State cancer registry linkage identified 1,052 primary incident endometrial cancers from baseline through December 31, 2003. In multivariate proportional hazards models, vigorous activity was inversely associated with endometrial cancer in a dose-response manner (p for trend = 0.02) (relative risk (RR) for >or=5 times/week vs. never/rarely = 0.77, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.95); this association was more pronounced among overweight and obese women (body mass index >or=25; RR = 0.61, 95{\%} CI: 0.47-0.79) than among lean women (body mass index <25; RR = 0.76, 95{\%} CI: 0.52-1.10; p for interaction = 0.12). Although we observed no associations with light/moderate, daily routine or occupational physical activities, risk did increase with number of hours of daily sitting (p for trend = 0.02). Associations with vigorous activities, which may interact with body mass index, suggest directions for future research to clarify underlying biologic mechanisms, including those relating to hormonal alterations.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: Although independent relationships between sitting behaviors (mainly television viewing) and health outcomes have been reported, few studies have examined the measurement properties of self-report sitting questions. This study assessed gender specific test-retest reliability and validity of a questionnaire that assessed time spent sitting on weekdays and weekend-days: 1) traveling to/from places; 2) at work; 3) watching television; 4) using a computer at home; and 5) for leisure, not including television. METHODS:: Test-retest reliability of domain-specific sitting-time (min/d) on week-days and weekend-days was assessed using data collected on two occasions (median 11 d apart). Validity of domain- specific self-reported sitting time on week-days and weekend-days was assessed against log data and sedentary accelerometer data. RESULTS:: Complete repeat questionnaire and log data were obtained from 157 women (aged 51-59 years) and 96 men (aged 45-63 years). Reliability coefficients were high for week-day sitting time at work, watching television and using a computer at home (rs=0.84-0.78), but lower for weekend-days across all domains (rs=0.23-0.74). Validity coefficients were highest for week-day sitting time at work and using a computer at home (rs=0.69-0.74). With the exception of computer use and watching television for women, validity of the weekend-day sitting time items were low. CONCLUSIONS:: This study confirms the importance of measuring domain- and day-specific sitting time. The measurement properties of questions that assess structured domain-specific and week-day sitting time were acceptable and may be used in future studies that aim to elucidate associations between domain-specific sitting and health outcomes.},

abstract = {The concepts of "self-tracking" and "the quantified self" have recently begun to emerge in discussions of how best to optimize one's life. These concepts refer to the practice of gathering data about oneself on a regular basis and then recording and analyzing the data to produce statistics and other data (such as images) relating to one's bodily functions and everyday habits. Some self-trackers collect data on only one or two dimensions of their lives, and only for a short time. Others may do so for hundreds of phenomena and for long periods.The tracking and analysis of aspects of one's self and one's body are not new practices. People have been recording their habits and health-related metrics for centuries as part of attempts at self-reflection and self-improvement. What is indisputably new is the term “the quantified self” and its associated movement, which includes a dedicated website with that title, and regular meetings and conferences, as well as the novel ways of self-tracking using digital technologies that have developed in recent years. A growing range of digital devices with associated apps are now available for self-tracking. Many of these devicescan be worn on or close to the body to measure elements of the user's everyday life and activities and produce data that can be recorded and monitored by the user. They include not only digital cameras, smartphones, tablet computers, watches, wireless weight scales, and blood pressure monitors, but also wearable bands or patches, clip-on devices and jewelry with embedded sensors able to measure bodily functions or movement and upload data wirelessly. In many of these devices global positioning devices, gyroscopes, altimeters, and accelerometers provide spatial location and quantify movement. These technologies allow self-trackers to collect data on their moods, diet, dreams, social encounters, posture, sexual activity, blood chemistry, heart rate, body temperature, exercise patterns, brain- function, alcohol, coffee and tobacco consumption, and many other variables.},

abstract = {The concept of ‘self-tracking’ (also referred to as life-logging, the quantified self, personal analytics and personal informatics) has recently begun to emerge in discussions of ways in which people can voluntarily monitor and record specific features of their lives, often using digital technologies. There is evidence that the personal data that are derived from individuals engaging in such reflexive self-monitoring are now beginning to be used by actors, agencies and organisations beyond the personal and privatised realm. Self-tracking rationales and sites are proliferating as part of a ‘function creep’ of the technology and ethos of self-tracking. The detail offered by these data on individuals and the growing commodification and commercial value of digital data have led government, managerial and commercial enterprises to explore ways of appropriating self-tracking for their own purposes. In some contexts people are encouraged, ‘nudged’, obliged or coerced into using digital devices to produce personal data which are then used by others. This paper examines these issues, outlining five modes of self-tracking that have emerged: private, communal, pushed, imposed and exploited. The analysis draws upon theoretical perspectives on concepts of selfhood, citizenship, biopolitics and data practices and assemblages in discussing the wider sociocultural implications of the emergence and development of these modes of self-tracking.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Hvidoere Study Group on Childhood Diabetes has demonstrated persistent differences in metabolic outcomes between pediatric diabetes centers. These differences cannot be accounted for by differences in demographic, medical, or treatment variables. Therefore, we sought to explore whether differences in physical activity or sedentary behavior could explain the variation in metabolic outcomes between centers. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional international study in 21 centers, with demographic and clinical data obtained by questionnaire from participants. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were assayed in one central laboratory. All individuals with diabetes aged 11-18 yr (49.4{\%} female), with duration of diabetes of at least 1 yr, were invited to participate. Individuals completed a self-reported measure of quality of life (Diabetes Quality of Life - Short Form [DQOL-SF]), with well-being and leisure time activity assessed using measures developed by Health Behaviour in School Children WHO Project. RESULTS: Older participants (p < 0.001) and females (p < 0.001) reported less physical activity. Physical activity was associated with positive health perception (p < 0.001) but not with glycemic control, body mass index, frequency of hypoglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. The more time spent on the computer (r = 0.06; p < 0.05) and less time spent doing school homework (r = -0.09; p < 0.001) were associated with higher HbA1c. Between centers, there were significant differences in reported physical activity (p < 0.001) and sedentary behavior (p < 0.001), but these differences did not account for center differences in metabolic control. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity is strongly associated with psychological well-being but has weak associations with metabolic control. Leisure time activity is associated with individual differences in HbA1c but not with intercenter differences.},

abstract = {AIM: To describe the time children spend watching television (TV) and to assess associations between TV viewing time, the family environment and weight status. METHODS: Parents reported the amount of time children watched TV/video both for 'the previous school day' and 'usually' and described aspects of the family environment influencing TV access as part of a large cross-sectional study in the Barwon South-western region of Victoria, Australia. Child weight status was based on measured height and weight. All data were collected in 2003/2004. RESULTS: A total of 1926 children aged 4-12 years participated. Parent-reported mean +/- SE TV time for the previous school day was 83 +/- 1.5 min. Children who lived in a family with tight rules governing TV viewing time (22{\%}), or who never watched TV during dinner (33{\%}), or had only one TV in the household (23{\%}) or had no TV in their bedroom (81{\%}) had significantly less TV time than their counterparts. Overweight or obese children had more TV time than healthy weight children 88 +/- 2.9 versus 82 +/- 1.7 min per day (P=0.04). They were also more likely to live in a household where children had a TV in their bedroom than healthy weight children (25{\%} vs. 17{\%}, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Strategies to reduce TV time should be included as part of broader strategies to prevent childhood obesity. They should include messages to parents about not having a TV in children's bedrooms, encouraging family rules restricting TV viewing, and not having the TV on during dinner.},

A systematic search through databases and review articles was carried out. Our results show that theory-based interventions (k = 82) significantly impact the PA behaviour of participants (d = 0.31, 95{\%} CI [0.24, 0.37]). While moderation analyses revealed no efficacy difference between theories, interventions based on a single theory (d = 0.35; 95{\%} CI [0.26, 0.43]) reported a higher impact on PA behaviour than those based on a combination of theories (d = 0.21; 95{\%} CI [0.11, 0.32]). In spite of the global positive effect of theory-based interventions on PA behaviour, further research is required to better identify the specificities, overlaps or complementarities of the components of interventions based on relevant theories.},

Ecological frameworks have provided the field with a heuristic means of capturing potential impacts on behavior across diverse domains, including personal, behavioral, social or cultural, and environmental. We discuss advances in both understanding and applying this framework through the inclusion of previously ignored dimensions of impact (e.g., time), the application of state-of-the-art statistical methods for understanding interactions among multiple domains (e.g., signal detection), and the development of computer technologies (e.g., agent-based modeling) aimed at simulating the complex relationships between multiple levels of impact and walking behavior. We conclude with suggestions for future research in this emerging field.},

Although regular physical activity has a range of benefits, very few adults in the USA meet recommended guidelines for daily physical activity. The meta-analysis of Fanning et al. (2012) aimed to synthesize the results of research using mobile devices to increase physical activity. Their review identified 11 studies that used mobile technologies, including short message service (SMS), apps, or personal digital assistant (PDA) to improve physical activity behaviors among participants. Fanning et al. conclude that while literature in this area is limited to date, there is initial support for the efficacy of mobile-based interventions for improving physical activity. Included studies varied greatly, and the majority used only SMS to influence physical behaviors, meaning generalization of results to other forms of mobile technologies may be premature. This review does, however, provide a foundation for understanding how mobile-based interventions may be used efficaciously for the development of future interventions to improve health behaviors.},

abstract = {Excerpt: Scientific research has always been a collaborative undertaking, and this is particularly true today. For example, between 1981 and 2001, the average number of coauthors on a paper for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U S A rose from 3.9 to 8.4 1. Why the increase? Biology has always been considered the study of living systems; many of us now think of it as the study of complex systems. Understanding this complexity requires experts in many different domains. In short, these days success in being a biologist depends more on one's ability to collaborate than ever before. The Medical Research Centers in the United Kingdom figured this out long ago, and the new Janelia Farm research campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the United States has got the idea, as it strongly promotes intra- and inter-institutional collaborations 2. Given that collaboration is crucial, how do you go about picking the right collaborators, and how can you best make the collaboration work? Here are ten simple rules based on our experience that we hope will help. Additional suggestions can be found in the references 3,4. Above all, keep in mind that these rules are for both you and your collaborators. Always remember to treat your collaborators as you would want to be treated yourselfempathy is key},

The purpose of the study was to reduce measurement error in step-count data by controlling a) the length of the measurement period and b) the season or month of the year in which sampling was conducted. Methods: Twenty-three middle-aged adults were instructed to wear a Yamax SW-200 pedometer over 365 consecutive days. The step-count measurement periods of various lengths (eg, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days, etc.) were randomly selected 10 times for each season and month. To determine accurate estimates of yearly step-count measurement, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and bias were calculated. The year-round average was considered as a criterion measure. A smaller MAPE and bias represent a better estimate. Results: Differences in MAPE and bias among seasons were trivial; however, they varied among different months. The months in which seasonal changes occur presented the highest MAPE and bias. Conclusions: Targeting the data collection during certain months (eg, May) may reduce pedometer measurement error and provide more accurate estimates of year-round averages.},

@article{Sniehotta2009,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Briefly review the current state of theorizing about volitional behaviour change and identification of challenges and possible solutions for future theory development.

METHOD: Review of the literature and theoretical analysis.

RESULTS: Reasoned action theories have made limited contributions to the science of behaviour change as they do not propose means of changing cognitions or account for existing effective behaviour change techniques. Changing beliefs does not guarantee behaviour change. The implementation intentions (IMPs) approach to planning has advanced theorizing but the applications to health behaviours often divert substantially from the IMPs paradigm with regard to interventions, effects, mediators and moderators. Better construct definitions and differentiations are needed to make further progress in integrating theory and understanding behaviour change.

CONCLUSIONS: Further progress in theorizing can be achieved by (a) disentangling planning constructs to study their independent and joint effects on behaviour, (b) progressing research on moderators and mediators of planning effects outside the laboratory and (c) integrating planning processes within learning theory and self-regulation theory.},

We examined obesity incidence, persistence, and reversal in a nationally representative cohort of US teens followed into their early 30s, using measured height and weight data, in individuals enrolled in wave II (1996; 12-21 years), wave III (2001; 17-26 years), and wave IV (2008 early release data; 24-32 years) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 8,675). Obesity was defined as a BMI >/=95th percentile of the 2000 Centers for Disease Control/National Center for Health Statistics growth charts or >/=30 kg/m(2) for individuals <20 years and >/=30 kg/m(2) in individuals >/=20 years. In 1996, 13.3{\%} of adolescents were obese. By 2008, obesity prevalence increased to 36.1{\%}, and was highest among non-Hispanic black females (54.8{\%}). Ninety percent of the obese adolescents remained obese in 2008. While annual obesity incidence did not decline in the total sample across the two study intervals (2.3{\%} per year 1996-2001 vs. 2.2{\%} per year 2001-2008), rates among white females declined (2.7 to 1.9{\%} per year) and were highest among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic females (3.8 and 2.7{\%} per year, 1996-2001 vs. 3.0 and 2.6{\%} per year, 2002-2008, respectively). Obesity prevalence doubled from adolescence to the early 20s, and doubled again from the early to late 20s or early 30s, with strong tracking from adolescence into adulthood. This trend is likely to continue owing to high rates of pediatric obesity. Effective preventive and treatment efforts are critically needed.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between physical activity and mortality in a 7-year follow-up of a sample of women more than 30 years of age (N = 6,620) from the Canada Fitness Survey cohort, which was initiated in 1981. Age-adjusted relative risks relating quartiles of average daily energy expenditure (kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per day) to mortality were estimated using logistic regression. Compared with the least active, the risk of all-cause mortality was 0.73 for those in the highest quartile (P for trend = 0.03). The associations were stronger for cardiovascular disease mortality (odds ratio = 0.51; P for trend = 0.01) and fatal myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 0.61; P for trend = 0.04) for those in the highest quartile. These relations were due mainly to the contribution of non-leisure (household chores) energy expenditure, which represented, on average, 82{\%} of women's total activity. The accompanying study on the same cohort by Villeneuve et al reported estimates based on a subset of leisure-time physical activity only, which underestimates the activity of many women (Villeneuve PJ, Morrison HI, Craig CL, Schaubel DE. Physical activity, physical fitness, and risk of dying. Epidemiology 1998;9;632-635). The resulting bias illustrates the importance of including non-leisure energy expenditure in the assessment of total activity. These data support the hypothesis that physical activity is inversely associated with risk of death in women.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To explore whether characteristics of the U.S. secondary school physical activity environment are associated with student body mass index (BMI) and physical activity. METHODS: This report uses data from two studies: Monitoring the Future (MTF; an annual nationally representative survey of 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade public and private school students) and Youth, Education, and Society (a survey of administrators in schools that have completed their 2-year participation in the MTF study). School policies and programs related to various health issues, including physical education (PE) and sports activity, were examined for relationships with student self-reported height, weight, being active in sports, exercising vigorously, and participating in school athletics. RESULTS: The results show that in 2004-2007, the percentage of students who attended schools that required PE in their grade differed sharply by grade level: 88{\%} of 8th graders, 48{\%} of 10th graders, and 20{\%} of 12th graders. There were few statistically significant associations between school PE requirements and student BMI. The average percentage of students who participated in interscholastic or varsity sports was associated at the bivariate level with a lower percentage of students being overweight in all three grades. Other measures of PE and sports activity showed varying associations with BMI and physical activity measures. CONCLUSIONS: Relationships between the school physical activity environment and student BMI and physical activity were not uniformly strong. We conclude that, as currently practiced in schools, existing variations in physical activity policies may not be sufficient to produce discernible school-wide differences; thus, there is a need for more vigorous PE programming than is typically provided.},

abstract = {Promoting physical activity has become a priority because of its role in preventing childhood obesity and chronic disease. Ecological approaches that recognise the interaction between individuals and the settings in which they spend their time are currently at the forefront of public health action. Schools have been identified as a key setting for health promotion. An overview of the literature addressed the promotion of physical activity in schools and showed that school-based strategies (elementary or high school) that utilised classroom-based education only did not increase physical activity levels; one notable exception was screen time interventions. Although evidence is sparse, active school models and environmental strategies (interventions that change policy and practice) appear to promote physical activity in elementary schools effectively. There is also strong evidence to support multicomponent models in high schools, particularly models that incorporate a family and community component. An emerging trend is to involve youth in the development and implementation of interventions. In the context of childhood obesity and sedentary lifestyles, modest increases in physical activity levels in school-based trials are important. School initiatives must be supported and reinforced in other community settings. Health professionals play a key role as champions in the community, based on their influence and credibility. Health professionals can lend support to school-based efforts by asking about and emphasising the importance of physical activity with patients, encouraging family-based activities, supporting local schools to adopt an "active school" approach and advocating for support to sustain evidence-based and promising physical activity models within schools.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Direct-to-consumer mHealth devices are a potential asset to behavioral research but rarely tested as intervention tools. This trial examined the accelerometer-based Fitbit tracker and website as a low-touch physical activity intervention. The purpose of this study is to evaluate, within an RCT, the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of integrating the Fitbit tracker and website into a physical activity intervention for postmenopausal women.

METHODS: Fifty-one inactive, postmenopausal women with BMI ≥25.0 were randomized to a 16-week web-based self-monitoring intervention (n=25) or comparison group (n=26). The Web-Based Tracking Group received a Fitbit, instructional session, and follow-up call at 4 weeks. The comparison group received a standard pedometer. All were asked to perform 150 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Physical activity outcomes were measured by the ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer.

RESULTS: Data were collected and analyzed in 2013-2014. Participants were aged 60 (SD=7) years with BMI of 29.2 (3.5) kg/m(2). Relative to baseline, the Web-Based Tracking Group increased MVPA by 62 (108) minutes/week (p<0.01); 10-minute MVPA bouts by 38 (83) minutes/week (p=0.008); and steps by 789 (1,979) (p=0.01), compared to non-significant increases in the Pedometer Group (between-group p=0.11, 0.28, and 0.30, respectively). The Web-Based Tracking Group wore the tracker on 95{\%} of intervention days; 96{\%} reported liking the website and 100{\%} liked the tracker.

CONCLUSIONS: The Fitbit was well accepted in this sample of women and associated with increased physical activity at 16 weeks. Leveraging direct-to-consumer mHealth technologies aligned with behavior change theories can strengthen physical activity interventions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a 3-month minimal physical activity (PA) intervention in adolescents. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial, including five secondary schools (n=87). In the 3-month intervention (Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2005) adolescents were provided with a PAM accelerometer, coupled to a web-based tailored PA advice (PAM COACH). Measurements (i.e., PA, determinants of PA, aerobic fitness and anthropometrics) took place at baseline and at 3- and 8-month follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of the participants in the intervention group reported to have worn the PAM frequently and 56{\%} of the PAM users uploaded their PAM scores to the PAM COACH at least once. We found significant differences between groups in favour of the intervention group in moderate intensity PA (MPA) for girls after 3 months (411 min/week; 95{\%} CI: 1; 824; P=0.04) and in sedentary time for boys after 8 months (-1801 min/week; 95{\%} CI: -3545; -57; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Although the process evaluation suggests that a substantial proportion of the participants did not regularly wear the PAM and did not upload information to the PAM COACH website, our findings suggest promising intervention effects on MPA among girls and sedentary time among boys.},

abstract = {Objective In this study, behavioural and social correlates of objectively measured sedentary time in young people were identified. Design Cross-sectional analysis of data from the European Youth Heart Study (EYHS). Setting Schools in Denmark, Estonia, Portugal and Norway. Participants Respondents were invited using a twostage cluster sampling procedure. Analyses include 2107 children (9-10 years old) and adolescents (14-15 years old). Assessment of independent variables Seven behavioural and 15 social variables assessed by parental and computerised child questionnaires. Main outcome measure Sedentary activity as assessed by accelerometry (10 min blocks at <200 counts/min). Analyses were stratified by country, and interactions with grade and sex were investigated. Results Adolescents were more sedentary than children (335.4 (90.4 min/day) vs 217.2 (75.6 min/day), p<0.001). Patterns of associations differed across countries. High computer use and no television viewing before school in Norway, and being sedentary during school breaks in Estonia were positively associated with sedentary time. No behavioural variables were associated with sedentary time in the Danish and Portuguese models. Socioeconomic position was positively associated with sedentary time in Portugal and Estonia, father's body mass index negatively in the Estonian model. Norwegian participants with a game console at home and Portuguese participants with a television in their bedroom were more sedentary. Conclusions A single strategy aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour is unlikely to be effective across Europe as the target populations and behaviours of focus differ between countries. Targeting high socioeconomic groups in Portugal and Estonia or focusing on reducing computer use in Norway might be effective intervention strategies to reduce overall sedentary time.},

These ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are treatments that are provided to people during their everyday lives (i.e. in real time) and in natural settings (i.e. real world).

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine test-retest reliability of global positioning system (GPS) units for measuring distance traveled when walking and cycling (AT), and to determine whether GPS unit placement influences accuracy. METHODS: Participants (N = 19) completed two walking and cycling trials at self-selected speeds on a measured 1489-m course wearing two Garmin GPS units, worn in lanyard and waistband placements. GPS estimates of travel distance were compared with actual distance, and test-retest reliability was examined. Data-cleaning protocols were developed to remove signal noise. Results are presented for both raw and cleaned data. RESULTS: For both raw and cleaned data, no significant differences were observed between trials (trial 1 vs trial 2), unit placement (lanyard vs waistband), or AT mode (walk vs cycle) (P >or= 0.05). Both lanyard and waistband units significantly overestimated distance traveled during walking trials (P <or= 0.05), but not cycling trials (P >or= 0.05). The relative technical error of measurement (TEM) of the raw data ranged from 3.74 to 15.51{\%}, and average absolute errors ranged from 5.03 to 8.53{\%} for all trials. A significant position by AT mode interaction was observed for clean data (P < 0.05). Relative TEM for the clean data ranged from 1.42 to 1.98{\%}, and average absolute errors ranged from 0.32 to 1.97{\%}. Intraclass correlations (ICC) were poor to fair for all trials using raw and cleaned data. CONCLUSION: Signal noise during unit initialization may adversely affect unit performance; however, application of data-cleaning procedures to remove data associated with signal noise improves unit ability to measure distance. Results suggest that the lanyard position is the optimal placement for units during data collection.},

abstract = {Clinical obesity treatments are of limited reach. Self-directed weight control attempts are common, but little attention has been given to providing guidance for such efforts in the population. The present research tests a brief intervention approach to weight control. Pilot data were collected from 66 University of Minnesota employees (72.7{\%} women, 81.8{\%} white) randomized to an assessment-only control condition or a single intervention session to teach empirically valid self-directed weight-control methods. Mean baseline weight was 87.1 kilograms (range 64.0-120.3 kilograms). Though statistically nonsignificant, intervention participants averaged greater weight loss by 6 months than controls (-.80 kilograms vs. -.19 kilograms), F(1, 44)=.47, p=.50, Cohen's d=.21. There was a significant group×time interaction for self-weighing frequency, F(2, 41)=10.84, p<.001. With some enhancement and more attention to dissemination, a brief self-directed program has potential as a useful approach to population weight-gain prevention.},

abstract = {Objective: Meta-analyses of behavior change (BC) interventions typically find large heterogeneity in effectiveness and small effects. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of active BC interventions designed to promote physical activity and healthy eating and investigate whether theoretically specified BC techniques improve outcome. Design: Interventions, evaluated in experimental or quasi-experimental studies, using behavioral and/or cognitive techniques to increase physical activity and healthy eating in adults, were systematically reviewed. Intervention content was reliably classified into 26 BC techniques and the effects of individual techniques, and of a theoretically derived combination of self-regulation techniques, were assessed using meta-regression. Main Outcome Measures: Valid outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating. Results: The 122 evaluations (N = 44,747) produced an overall pooled effect size of 0.31 (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.26 to 0.36, I-2 = 69{\%}). The technique, "self-monitoring," explained the greatest amount of among-study heterogeneity (13{\%}). Interventions that combined self-monitoring with at least one other technique derived from control theory were significantly more effective than the other interventions (0.42 vs. 0.26). Conclusion: Classifying interventions according to component techniques and theoretically derived technique combinations and conducting meta-regression enabled identification of effective components of interventions designed to increase physical activity and healthy eating.},

abstract = {Background: Several thousand mobile phone apps are available to download to mobile phones for health and fitness. Mobile phones may provide a unique means of administering health interventions to populations. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to systematically search and describe the literature on mobile apps used in health behavior interventions, describe the behavioral features and focus of health apps, and to evaluate the potential of apps to disseminate health behavior interventions. Methods: We conducted a review of the literature in September 2014 using key search terms in several relevant scientific journal databases. Only English articles pertaining to health interventions using mobile phone apps were included in the final sample. Results: The 24 studies identified for this review were primarily feasibility and pilot studies of mobile apps with small sample sizes. All studies were informed by behavioral theories or strategies, with self-monitoring as the most common construct. Acceptability of mobile phone apps was high among mobile phone users. Conclusions: The lack of large sample studies using mobile phone apps may signal a need for additional studies on the potential use of mobile apps to assist individuals in changing their health behaviors. Of these studies, there is early evidence that apps are well received by users. Based on available research, mobile apps may be considered a feasible and acceptable means of administering health interventions, but a greater number of studies and more rigorous research and evaluations are needed to determine efficacy and establish evidence for best practices.

abstract = {Objective: Many health-promoting interventions combine multiple behavior change techniques (BCTs) to maximize effectiveness. Although, in theory, BCTs can amplify each other, the available meta- analyses have not been able to identify specific combinations of techniques that provide synergistic effects. This study overcomes some of the shortcomings in the current methodology by applying classification and regression trees (CART) to meta-analytic data in a special way, referred to as Meta-CART. The aim was to identify particular combinations of BCTs that explain intervention success. Method: A reanalysis of data from Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, and Gupta (2009) was performed. These data included effect sizes from 122 interventions targeted at physical activity and healthy eating, and the coding of the interventions into 26 BCTs. A CART analysis was performed using the BCTs as predictors and treatment success (i.e., effect size) as outcome. A subgroup meta-analysis using a mixed effects model was performed to compare the treatment effect in the subgroups found by CART. Results: Meta-CART identified the following most effective combinations: Provide information about behavior–health link with Prompt intention formation (mean effect size g ? ? 0.46), and Provide information about behavior–health link with Provide information on consequences and Use of follow-up prompts (g ? ? 0.44). Least effective interventions were those using Provide feedback on performance without using Provide instruction (g ? ? 0.05). Conclusions: Specific combinations of BCTs increase the likelihood of achieving change in health behavior, whereas other combinations decrease this likelihood. Meta-CART successfully identified these combinations and thus provides a viable methodology in the context of meta-analysis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the effect of keeping daily activity records on physical activity levels and self-efficacy for physical activity in adults with type 2 diabetes, and to examine the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention from the perspective of the participants.

METHODS: This intervention study included 58 individuals with type 2 diabetes aged 40 to 65 years. Participants were randomly assigned: individuals in the intervention group kept daily activity records for 6 weeks, mailed to the researcher every 2 weeks. Data collection was completed at the beginning of the study and 6 weeks later, using the habitual physical activity index and the self-efficacy for exercise scale. Participants in the intervention group also completed the perceived feasibility checklist.

RESULTS: The intervention resulted in enhanced self-efficacy. Physical activity improved in both the intervention and control groups. Activity recording was judged to be acceptable and feasible.

CONCLUSIONS: Daily activity recording can be used as part of a program to increase physical activity self-efficacy levels. Focused interactions between health care providers and patients may be enough to motivate people to higher levels of physical activity. The relationship between self-efficacy and behavior is complex and should be the subject of further research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a relationship between the time adolescents spend in physical activity and time they spend in different sedentary pursuits: watching television, playing video games, working on computers, doing homework, and reading, taking into account the effect of part-time work on students' residual time. DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort design. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Seven hundred forty-three high school students from 2 inner-city public schools and 1 private school. METHODS: Students completed a self-administered questionnaire that addressed time spent in physical activity, time spent in sedentary pursuits, musculoskeletal pain, and psychosocial issues and were also measured for height and weight. Main Outcome Measure Level of physical activity (low, moderate, high). RESULTS: There were more girls than boys in the low and moderate physical activity groups and more boys than girls in the high activity group. Ordinal logistic regression showed that increased time spent in "productive sedentary behavior" (reading or doing homework and working on computers) was associated with increased physical activity (odds ratio, 1.7; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.2-2.4), as was time spent working (odds ratio, 1.3; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.2-1.4). Time spent watching television and playing video games was not associated with decreased physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity was not inversely associated with watching television or playing video games, but was positively associated with productive sedentary behavior and part-time work. Some students appear capable of managing their time better than others. Future studies should explore the ability of students to manage their time and also determine what characteristics are conducive to better time management.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Rates of obesity and other childhood chronic conditions have increased over recent decades. Patterns of how conditions change over time have not been widely examined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate change in prevalence of obesity and other chronic conditions in US children, including incidence, remission, and prevalence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective study using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-Child Cohort (1988-2006) of 3 nationally representative cohorts of children. Children were aged 2 through 8 years at the beginning of each study period, and cohorts were followed up for 6 years, from 1988 to 1994 (cohort 1, n = 2337), 1994 to 2000 (cohort 2, n = 1759), and 2000 to 2006 (n = 905). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parent report of a child having a health condition that limited activities or schooling or required medicine, special equipment, or specialized health services and that lasted at least 12 months. Obesity was defined as a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for age. Chronic conditions were grouped into 4 categories: obesity, asthma, other physical conditions, and behavior/learning problems. RESULTS: The end-study prevalence of any chronic health condition was 12.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 11.2{\%}-14.5{\%}) for cohort 1 in 1994, 25.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 22.7{\%}-27.6{\%}) for cohort 2 in 2000, and 26.6{\%} (95{\%} CI, 23.5{\%}-29.9{\%}) for cohort 3 in 2006. There was substantial turnover in chronic conditions: 7.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 6.5{\%}-8.3{\%}) of participants in all cohorts had a chronic condition at the beginning of the study that persisted to the end, 9.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 8.3{\%}-10.3{\%}) reported conditions at the beginning that resolved within 6 years, and 13.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 12.3{\%}-14.6{\%}) had new conditions that arose during the 6-year study period. The prevalence of having a chronic condition during any part of the 6-year study period was highest for cohort 3 (51.5{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 47.3{\%}-55.0{\%}), and there were higher rates among male (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.42), Hispanic (AOR, 1.36; 95{\%} CI, 1.11-1.67), and black (AOR, 1.60; 95{\%} CI, 1.35-1.90) youth. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of chronic conditions among children and youth increased from 1988 to 2006. However, presence of these conditions was dynamic over each 6-year cohort.},

abstract = {Migrant studies of physical activity (PA) can provide insight into the prevention of chronic disease. It is unclear, however, whether PA increases or decreases the longer migrants live in their host country. In the US, studies on immigrants' length of residence in the US and PA are inconclusive and many studies do not adequately consider the role of socioeconomic status (SES). Using California data, we examine relationships between immigrant generation and physical activity (PA) among Mexican, Chinese and Filipino adults, who represent the three largest immigrant groups in the US, and the extent to which the relationships are confounded by SES. Data from the 2000 US Census was linked with data on adults 18 years and older from the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. PA was measured in three different domains: leisure time (LTPA), non-leisure time (NLTPA) and any PA. Logistic regression was used to examine whether a wide range of SES factors, measured at the respondent and neighborhood levels, influenced the relationship between immigrant generation and PA in all domains and in different ethnic origin groups. Generation was significantly associated with LTPA among Mexican and Chinese adults and with NLTPA among all 3 ethnic origin groups; however the nature of the relationships varied. After adjusting for individual and neighborhood SES factors, a positive association between generation and LTPA remained among Mexican adults, and negative association between generation and NLTPA remained among Chinese and Filipino adults. These results underscore the importance of comparative studies of immigrant generation and PA and consideration of SES factors to identify pathways linking generation to PA. In the context of increasing rates of chronic disease, the study of transitions in PA among immigrants will continue to be critical to promoting the public health of diverse populations in countries such as the US.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of time spent in sedentary behaviors (e.g., TV/video and computer use) among youth in the US. METHODS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-06) provided data to examine sedentary behavior across age groups (2-5, 6-11, and 12-15 years of age), ethnic groups (European [EA], African [AA], and Mexican American [MA]), and body mass index (BMI) categories (normal weight, overweight, obese). RESULTS: The sample included 8 707 (50.7{\%} boys) children aged 2 to 15 years. Seventy percent of the sample was normal weight, 18.1{\%} was overweight, and 11.5{\%} was obese. The total proportion of young people engaged in TV/video viewing, computer use, and total screen time > or = 2 hours daily was 33.0{\%}, 6.7{\%}, and 47.3{\%}, respectively. More boys (49.4{\%}) than girls (45.0{\%}); older (12-15 years: 56.0{\%}) versus younger children (2-5 years: 35.3{\%} and 6-11 years: 49.1{\%}); AA (66.1{\%}) versus EA (42.5{\%}) and MA (46.1{\%}); obese (58.5{\%}) versus overweight (50.8{\%}) versus normal weight (44.6{\%}); and low and middle income (<{\$}25 K: 51.4{\%} and {\$}25-45 K: 51.2{\%}) versus high income (>{\$}45 K: 42.6{\%}) children spent > or = 2 hours daily in screen time. CONCLUSION: Nearly half (47{\%}) of US children exceed > or = 2 hours/day of time in sedentary behavior. Further, it appears there are gender, age, ethnic, BMI-defined weight status, and income differences in exceeding > or = 2 hours/day in sedentary behavior. These results will be useful in planning targeted interventions at those populations with a higher prevalence of sedentary behavior.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between increased physical activity in adolescence and adult weight status. DESIGN: Cohort study based on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. SETTING: In-home interviews. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3345 adolescents in grades 8 to 12 with body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) data available at baseline and 5 years later. Main Exposures Days per week of curricular and extracurricular physical activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Overweight status (body mass index > or =25) 5 years after baseline. RESULTS: Increasing participation in certain extracurricular physical activities and physical education decreased the likelihood of young adulthood overweight. Regarding extracurricular physical activities, the likelihood of being an overweight adult was reduced most (ie, 48{\%}) by performing certain wheel-related activities (ie, rollerblading, roller skating, skateboarding, or bicycling) more than 4 times per week. Each weekday that adolescents participated in physical education decreased the odds of being an overweight adult by 5{\%}, with participation in all 5 weekdays of physical education decreasing the odds by 28{\%}. In general, physical activity predicted normal-weight maintenance better than weight loss. CONCLUSION: These data underscore the important role that school-based and extracurricular physical activity play in reducing the likelihood of transitioning to overweight as young adults.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessing time spent in sedentary behaviours in relation to pubertal status, anthropometric differences, and body image will improve insight into the prevalence and determinants of such behaviours during adolescence. AIM: The study aimed to investigate the effects of age, puberty, gender, body composition, and sleep on sedentary behaviour. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants were 64 boys and 55 girls in Year 6 (10.0-10.9 years of age), Year 8 (12.0-12.9 years) and Year 10 (14.0-14.9 years). Body mass index and percentage body fat were calculated from anthropometric measures. Sedentary behaviour and sleep time were computed using momentary-time sampling. Body image was measured using the Children's Physical Self-Perception Profile. Pubertal status was assessed from self-report of secondary sexual characteristics. RESULTS: After controlling for sleep time, no differences in sedentary time were seen for puberty onset or increased pubertal development. Correlations between pubertal status, body composition, and body image were stronger in girls than in boys. Correlations between body image and sedentary behaviour were not strong enough to infer behavioural choice differences. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced sleep time rather than changing body image and body composition during adolescence is associated with greater sedentary behaviour.},

abstract = {Vegetables and fruits are rich in carotenoids, a group of compounds thought to protect against cancer. Studies of diet-disease associations need valid and reliable instruments for measuring dietary intake. The authors present a measurement error model to estimate the validity (defined as correlation between self-reported intake and "true" intake), systematic error, and reliability of two self-report dietary assessment methods. Carotenoid exposure is measured by repeated 24-hour recalls, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and a plasma marker. The model is applied to 1,013 participants assigned between 1995 and 2000 to the nonintervention arm of the Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study, a randomized trial assessing the impact of a low-fat, high-vegetable/fruit/fiber diet on preventing new breast cancer events. Diagnostics including graphs are used to assess the goodness of fit. The validity of the instruments was 0.44 for the 24-hour recalls and 0.39 for the FFQ. Systematic error accounted for over 22{\%} and 50{\%} of measurement error variance for the 24-hour recalls and FFQ, respectively. The use of either self-report method alone in diet-disease studies could lead to substantial bias and error. Multiple methods of dietary assessment may provide more accurate estimates of true dietary intake.},

abstract = {Low back pain (LBP) has been identified as one of the most costly disorders among the worldwide working population. Sitting has been associated with risk of developing LBP. The purpose of this literature review is to assemble and describe evidence of research on the association between sitting and the presence of LBP. The systematic literature review was restricted to those occupations that require sitting for more than half of working time and where workers have physical co-exposure factors such as whole body vibration (WBV) and/or awkward postures. Twenty-five studies were carefully selected and critically reviewed, and a model was developed to describe the relationships between these factors. Sitting alone was not associated with the risk of developing LBP. However, when the co-exposure factors of WBV and awkward postures were added to the analysis, the risk of LBP increased fourfold. The occupational group that showed the strongest association with LBP was Helicopter Pilots (OR=9.0, 90{\%} CI 4.9-16.4). For all studied occupations, the odds ratio (OR) increased when WBV and/or awkward postures were analyzed as co-exposure factors. WBV while sitting was also independently associated with non-specific LBP and sciatica. Vibration dose, as well as vibration magnitude and duration of exposure, were associated with LBP in all occupations. Exposure duration was associated with LBP to a greater extent than vibration magnitude. However, for the presence of sciatica, this difference was not found. Awkward posture was also independently associated with the presence of LBP and/or sciatica. The risk effect of prolonged sitting increased significantly when the factors of WBV and awkward postures were combined. Sitting by itself does not increase the risk of LBP. However, sitting for more than half a workday, in combination with WBV and/or awkward postures, does increase the likelihood of having LBP and/or sciatica, and it is the combination of those risk factors, which leads to the greatest increase in LBP.},

In clinical application, self-monitoring has been noted to modify behavior, but its controlling variables have not yet been explored. Self-observation is an initial step in self-directed behavior change. Therefore, its consideration is also required for conceptualization of self-regulatory processes, viewed as integration of response feedback utilization, self-control, and self-reinforcement, to attain self or externally prescribed performance standards.

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the Happy 10 programme on the promotion of physical activity, physical growth and development of primary school students, and on obesity control and prevention. Two similar primary schools from one district of Beijing, China were selected, one as an intervention school and the other as a control school. A Happy 10 programme was implemented at least once every school day in the intervention school for two semesters, whereas no intervention was adopted in the control school. The information on energy expenditure and duration of physical activity was collected by a validated 7-day physical activity questionnaire. Height and weight were measured by the trained investigators following standardized procedure. Energy expenditure and intensity of each Happy 10 session were measured by a physical activity monitor. The average energy expenditure and duration of total physical activity per day among students in the intervention school increased significantly from 15.0 to 18.2 kcal kg(-1) and 2.8 to 3.3 h, respectively, whereas the figures significantly decreased in the control school. There was a significant difference in change of weight and body mass index between girls in the intervention and control school (2.4 kg vs. 4.6 kg; 0.47 kg m(-2) vs. 0.66 kg m(-2)). The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the intervention school decreased by 0.4-5.6{\%}, as compared with the increase by 0.6-4.5{\%} in the control school. The average energy expenditure and intensity per 10-min session ranged from 25.0 to 35.1 kcal and from 4.8 to 6.2 kcal kg(-1) h(-1), respectively, in grades 1-5. The Happy 10 programme provides a useful strategy to promote physical activity among school children, and also plays a positive role in building up physical growth and development of girls.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is related to premature mortality, the relationship between sedentary behaviors and mortality has not been fully explored and may represent a different paradigm than that associated with lack of exercise. We prospectively examined sitting time and mortality in a representative sample of 17,013 Canadians 18-90 yr of age. METHODS: Evaluation of daily sitting time (almost none of the time, one fourth of the time, half of the time, three fourths of the time, almost all of the time), leisure time physical activity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption was conducted at baseline. Participants were followed prospectively for an average of 12.0 yr for the ascertainment of mortality status. RESULTS: There were 1832 deaths (759 of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 547 of cancer) during 204,732 person-yr of follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was a progressively higher risk of mortality across higher levels of sitting time from all causes (hazard ratios (HR): 1.00, 1.00, 1.11, 1.36, 1.54; P for trend <0.0001) and CVD (HR:1.00, 1.01, 1.22, 1.47, 1.54; P for trend <0.0001) but not cancer. Similar results were obtained when stratified by sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index. Age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates per 10,000 person-yr of follow-up were 87, 86, 105, 130, and 161 (P for trend <0.0001) in physically inactive participants and 75, 69, 76, 98, 105 (P for trend = 0.008) in active participants across sitting time categories. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a dose-response association between sitting time and mortality from all causes and CVD, independent of leisure time physical activity. In addition to the promotion of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and a healthy weight, physicians should discourage sitting for extended periods.},

abstract = {In this paper we argue that the new availability of digital data sets allows one to revisit Gabriel Tarde's (1843-1904) social theory that entirely dispensed with using notions such as individual or society. Our argument is that when it was impossible, cumbersome or simply slow to assemble and to navigate through the masses of information on particular items, it made sense to treat data about social connections by defining two levels: one for the element, the other for the aggregates. But once we have the experience of following individuals through their connections (which is often the case with profiles) it might be more rewarding to begin navigating datasets without making the distinction between the level of individual component and that of aggregated structure. It becomes possible to give some credibility to Tarde's strange notion of 'monads'. We claim that it is just this sort of navigational practice that is now made possible by digitally available databases and that such a practice could modify social theory if we could visualize this new type of exploration in a coherent way.},

Prior randomized trials are not informative on this question because of small sample sizes and other limitations. Using variation across countries over time in SSRI sales and suicide, we find that an increase of one pill per capita (a 13 percent increase over 1999 levels) is associated with a 2.5 percent reduction in suicide rates, a relationship that is more pronounced for adults than for children. Our findings suggest that expanding access to SSRIs for adults may be a cost-effective way to save lives, although policymakers are right to remain cautious about pediatric use of SSRIs.},

Recently, many state laws and regulations addressing childhood obesity have been introduced and enacted. Understanding determinants of such legislation may inform the development and passage of future policies. For this study, key-informant interviews were conducted with 16 legislators and staffers from 11 states in 2005-2006 to examine qualitative factors that enable and impede state-level childhood obesity prevention legislation. Commonly cited factors positively influencing the passage of childhood obesity prevention legislation included national media exposure, introduction of the policy by senior legislators, and gaining the support of key players including parents, physicians, and schools. Noteworthy barriers included powerful lobbyists of companies that produce unhealthy foods and misconceptions about legislating foods at schools. Although the total number of informants was modest, their valuable insights provide policymakers and practitioners with a set of enablers and barriers to be considered when pursuing state-level policy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We used latent class analysis (LCA) to assess patterns of physical activity among adults, using the 7 d of accelerometer data from the 2003-2004 NHANES.

METHODS: For each participant, we determined the daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), vigorous physical activity (VPA), and minutes of MVPA that occurred in bouts of 10 min. Participants were then categorized into patterns of activity, using LCA and adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.

RESULTS: For overall MVPA, five classes of physical activity were defined, including two least active classes, which averaged less than 25 min of MVPA per day and represented 78.7{\%} of the total study population. The most active class averaged 134 min of MVPA per day and comprised 0.9{\%} of the population. The results for bout minutes of MVPA were similar to the patterns produced for overall MVPA, with the exception of a "weekend warrior" class with moderate levels of physical activity Monday through Friday but with a much higher level of activity on the weekend, particularly on Sunday. This class represented 1.8{\%} of the population. Only 1.4{\%} of all days achieved 10 min or more of VPA, and in 91.1{\%} of all days, participants accumulated less than 1 min of VPA. The LCA analysis of VPA did not produce stable results, because of the small number of participants registering any minutes of VPA.

CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a very large portion of the U.S. population may be classified into patterns of physical activity that represent low levels of MVPA throughout the week. The LCA analysis provided a novel approach for assessing patterns of objectively measured physical activity in epidemiologic studies.},

abstract = {We provide a wide-ranging review of health-related physical activity in children and adolescents using a behavioural epidemiology framework. In contrast to many other reviews, we highlight issues associated with true sedentary behaviours alongside physically active behaviours. Specifically, we review the evidence concerning the links between physical activity and cardiovascular disease, overweight and obesity, psychosocial measures, type II diabetes, and skeletal health. Although the evidence is unconvincing at times, several factors lead to the conclusion that promoting physical activity in youth is desirable. A review of the prevalence of physical activity and sedentary behaviours shows that many young people are active, but this declines with age. A substantial number are not adequately active for health benefits and current trends in juvenile obesity are a cause for concern. Prevalence data on sedentary behaviours are less extensive but suggest that total media use by young people has not changed greatly in recent years. Most children and adolescents do not exceed recommended daily hours of TV viewing. Physical activity is unrelated to TV viewing. We also identified the key determinants of physical activity in this age group, highlighting demographic, biological, psychological, behavioural, social and environmental determinants. Interventions were considered for school, family and community environments. Finally, policy recommendations are offered for the education, governmental, sport and recreation, health, and mass media sectors.},

abstract = {Getting enough sleep, exercising and limiting sedentary activities can greatly contribute to disease prevention and overall health and longevity. Measuring the full 24-hour activity cycle - sleep, sedentary behavior (SED), light intensity physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) - may now be feasible using small wearable devices. PURPOSE This study compares nine devices for accuracy in 24-hour activity measurement. METHODS Adults (N=40, 47{\%} male) wore nine devices for 24-hours: Actigraph GT3X+, activPAL, Fitbit One, GENEactiv, Jawbone Up, LUMOback, Nike Fuelband, Omron pedometer, and Z-Machine. Comparisons (to standards) were made for total sleep time (Z-machine), time spent in SED (activPAL), LPA (GT3x+), MVPA (GT3x+), and steps (Omron). Analysis included mean absolute percent error, equivalence testing, and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS Error rates ranged from 8.1-16.9{\%} for sleep; 9.5-65.8{\%} for SED; 19.7-28.0{\%} for LPA; 51.8-92{\%} for MVPA; and 14.1-29.9{\%} for steps. Equivalence testing indicated only two comparisons were significantly equivalent to standards: the LUMOback for sedentary behavior and the GT3X+ for sleep. Bland-Altman plots indicated GT3X+ had the closest measurement for sleep, LUMOback for sedentary behavior, GENEactiv for LPA, Fitbit for MVPA and GT3X+ for steps. CONCLUSIONS Currently, no device accurately captures activity data across the entire 24-hour day, but the future of activity measurement should aim for accurate 24-hour measurement as a goal. Researchers should continue to select measurement devices based on their primary outcomes of interest.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the association between sedentary behavior and obesity among 12-year-old children, while adjusting for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and other potential confounding variables. Cross-sectional analyses were carried out with data from 5,434 children who participated in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Fat mass was derived using dual-energy X-ray emission absorptiometry, and height and weight measurements were used to calculate BMI (kg/m(2)). The children wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The cut points for sedentary behavior and MVPA were or=3,600 counts per minute (cpm), respectively. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for potential confounders of physical activity that included gender, social factors, early life factors, and maturation. The minimally adjusted association between sedentary behavior and obesity was positive, OR = 1.18 (1.08, 1.28). After adjusting for the series of potential confounders of physical activity the positive association remained, OR = 1.32 (1.14, 1.53). The crude association between 15 min of MVPA per day and obesity was negative, OR = 0.54 (0.48, 0.62). When 15 min of MVPA per day was additionally controlled for in the models, the positive associations between sedentary behavior and obesity were negated. Sedentary behavior was positively associated with obesity in the 12-year-old children, but this association was not independent of MVPA; low levels of MVPA among the sedentary children increased the odds of obesity. These findings support the importance of specifically engaging in MVPA during childhood to reduce the prevalence of obesity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of a middle school physical activity intervention, new in combining an environmental and computer tailored component; and to evaluate the effects of parental involvement. METHODS: A clustered randomized controlled design was used. A random sample of 15 schools with 7th and 8th graders was randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) intervention with parental support, (b) intervention alone, and (c) control group. The intervention was new in combining environmental strategies with computer-tailored feedback to increase levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity. The intervention was implemented by the school staff. Physical activity was measured through a questionnaire in the total sample and with accelerometers in a sub sample of adolescents. RESULTS: The intervention with parental support led to an increase in self-reported school-related physical activity of, on average, 6.4 minutes per day (p < or = .05, d = .40). Physical activity of light intensity measured with accelerometers decreased with, on average, 36 minutes per day as a result of the intervention with parental support (p < or = .05, d = .54). Physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity measured with accelerometers significantly increased with on average 4 minutes per day in the intervention group with parental support, while it decreased with almost 7 minutes per day in the control group (p < or = .05, d = .46). CONCLUSIONS: The physical activity intervention, implemented by the school staff, resulted in enhanced physical activity behaviors in both middle school boys and girls. The combination of environmental approaches with computer-tailored interventions seemed promising.},

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Exercisers completed an online questionnaire assessing usage of apps, the health action process approach (HAPA) social cognitions, and PA.

RESULTS: A multivariate effect was found between app users and nonusers for HAPA social cognitions. Follow-up univariate analyses were calculated and determined that app users had significantly greater goal-setting efficacy, scheduling efficacy, recovery efficacy, action control, and planning compared with nonusers.

CONCLUSIONS: App use may be related to greater self-regulatory cognitions and skills. Future research should further explore app use in relation to social cognitions and long-term PA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large proportion of UK children do not reach the recommended levels of physical activity (PA) required for optimum health. Few studies have investigated the psychosocial correlates of objectively measured PA in preadolescents. This study examined child attitudes and parental behaviours as correlates of children's activity. METHODS: In total, 278 children (138 boys and 140 girls) aged 7-9 years were recruited as part of the Physical Exercise and Appetite in Children Study (PEACHES). Activity was objectively measured using the Actigraph GT1M accelerometer; the variables were total PA (mean accelerometer counts min(-1)) and moderate and vigorous PA (MVPA) >2000 counts min(-1). Child-focussed variables were self-efficacy (Physical Activity Self-Efficacy scale), physical performance self-concept (Self-Perception Profile for Children), positive and negative outcome expectancies and liking for PA. Parental variables were PA and support for child activity. RESULTS: Significant sex-by-psychosocial outcome interactions were observed for total PA and MVPA, so data from boys and girls were analysed separately. No psychosocial or parental outcomes were correlated with activity in girls. Significant correlates of activity in boys (self-efficacy, self-concept and parental support) were entered in to a hierarchical regression using both total PA and MVPA and, controlling for BMI SD, SES and ethnicity. PA self-efficacy and self-concept were significantly independently associated with total PA, explaining around 12{\%} of the variance. Self-efficacy was significantly associated with time spent in MVPA, also explaining around 12{\%} of the variance in this behaviour. Parental support was not significant in the regression model. CONCLUSION: PA self-efficacy and self-concept are significant correlates of objectively measured PA in UK boys.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Better understanding of the correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviors in youth will support the development of effective interventions that promote a physically active lifestyle and prevent a sedentary lifestyle. The main goal of this systematic review is to summarize and update the existing literature on correlates of young people's physical activity, insufficient physical activity, and sedentary behavior. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted and included studies published between January 1999 and January 2005. RESULTS: The 60 reviewed studies showed that for children (age range 4-12), gender (male), self-efficacy, parental physical activity (for boys), and parent support were positively associated with physical activity. For adolescents (age range 13-18), positive associations with physical activity were found for gender (male), parental education, attitude, self-efficacy, goal orientation/motivation, physical education/school sports, family influences, and friend support. For adolescents, a positive association was found between gender (male) and sedentary behavior, whereas an inverse association was found between gender and insufficient physical activity. Ethnicity (Caucasian), socioeconomic status, and parent education were found to be inversely associated with adolescents' sedentary behaviors. For children, the evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about correlates of insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior. CONCLUSION: To gain more insight in the correlates of change in physical activity levels, more prospective studies are needed. Moreover, further research is needed examining the correlates of insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviors, to develop effective interventions that may help children and adolescents diminish the time they spend on inactive behaviors.},

abstract = {Physical activity guidelines from around the world are typically expressed in terms of frequency, duration, and intensity parameters. Objective monitoring using pedometers and accelerometers offers a new opportunity to measure and communicate physical activity in terms of steps/day. Various step-based versions or translations of physical activity guidelines are emerging, reflecting public interest in such guidance. However, there appears to be a wide discrepancy in the exact values that are being communicated. It makes sense that step-based recommendations should be harmonious with existing evidence-based public health guidelines that recognize that "some physical activity is better than none" while maintaining a focus on time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Thus, the purpose of this review was to update our existing knowledge of "How many steps/day are enough?", and to inform step-based recommendations consistent with current physical activity guidelines. Normative data indicate that healthy adults typically take between 4,000 and 18,000 steps/day, and that 10,000 steps/day is reasonable for this population, although there are notable "low active populations." Interventions demonstrate incremental increases on the order of 2,000-2,500 steps/day. The results of seven different controlled studies demonstrate that there is a strong relationship between cadence and intensity. Further, despite some inter-individual variation, 100 steps/minute represents a reasonable floor value indicative of moderate intensity walking. Multiplying this cadence by 30 minutes (i.e., typical of a daily recommendation) produces a minimum of 3,000 steps that is best used as a heuristic (i.e., guiding) value, but these steps must be taken over and above habitual activity levels to be a true expression of free-living steps/day that also includes recommendations for minimal amounts of time in MVPA. Computed steps/day translations of time in MVPA that also include estimates of habitual activity levels equate to 7,100 to 11,000 steps/day. A direct estimate of minimal amounts of MVPA accumulated in the course of objectively monitored free-living behaviour is 7,000-8,000 steps/day. A scale that spans a wide range of incremental increases in steps/day and is congruent with public health recognition that "some physical activity is better than none," yet still incorporates step-based translations of recommended amounts of time in MVPA may be useful in research and practice. The full range of users (researchers to practitioners to the general public) of objective monitoring instruments that provide step-based outputs require good reference data and evidence-based recommendations to be able to design effective health messages congruent with public health physical activity guidelines, guide behaviour change, and ultimately measure, track, and interpret steps/day.},

STUDY DESIGN: Adult participants in the 2002 Styles surveys answered questions about their weekly TV viewing, knowledge, and rules. TV viewing time of children of the adult participants (520 boys and 525 girls) age 10 to 18 years was also collected. Associations between hours of child TV viewing and parental TV viewing, parental knowledge, and parental rules were quantified using linear regression techniques. RESULTS: Variables included in multivariate regression models accounted for 8{\%} to 18{\%} of the variance in TV viewing among boys and girls. Parent TV viewing was significantly associated with TV viewing in 10- to 12-year-old and 16- to 18-year-old boys and girls. Knowledge was not associated with TV viewing in boys and girls in this sample. Rules were associated with TV viewing in boys and girls of all ages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that parental TV viewing and rules limiting their child's TV time may play an important role in children's weekly TV viewing time.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, colon cancer, breast cancer, dementia and depression constitute a cluster of diseases, which defines 'a diseasome of physical inactivity'. Both physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity, reflecting accumulation of visceral fat mass, are associated with the occurrence of the diseases within the diseasome. Physical inactivity appears to be an independent and strong risk factor for accumulation of visceral fat, which again is a source of systemic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and tumour growth. Evidence suggests that the protective effect of exercise may to some extent be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory effect of regular exercise, which can be mediated via a reduction in visceral fat mass and/or by induction of an anti-inflammatory environment with each bout of exercise. The finding that muscles produce and release myokines provides a conceptual basis to understand the mechanisms whereby exercise influences metabolism and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. According to our theory, contracting skeletal muscles release myokines, which work in a hormone-like fashion, exerting specific endocrine effects on visceral fat. Other myokines work locally within the muscle via paracrine mechanisms, exerting their effects on signalling pathways involved in fat oxidation.},

abstract = {Aims Prolonged sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed economies and is associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile and premature mortality. This study examined the associations of objectively assessed sedentary time and breaks (interruptions) in sedentary time with continuous cardio-metabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers, and whether these associations varied by sex, age, and/or race/ethnicity. Methods and results Cross-sectional analyses with 4757 participants (≥20 years) from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An Actigraph accelerometer was used to derive sedentary time [<100 counts per minute (cpm)] and breaks in sedentary time. Independent of potential confounders, including moderate-to-vigorous exercise, detrimental linear associations (P for trends <0.05) of sedentary time with waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-{\%}B, and HOMA-{\%}S were observed. Independent of potential confounders and sedentary time, breaks were beneficially associated with waist circumference and C-reactive protein (P for trends <0.05). There was limited evidence of meaningful differences in associations with biomarkers by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Notable exceptions were sex-differences in the associations of sedentary time and breaks with HDL-cholesterol, and race/ethnicity differences in the association of sedentary time with waist circumference with associations detrimental in non-Hispanic whites, null in Mexican Americans, and beneficial in non-Hispanic blacks. Conclusion These are the first population-representative findings on the deleterious associations of prolonged sedentary time with cardio-metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. The findings suggest that clinical communications and preventive health messages on reducing and breaking up sedentary time may be beneficial for cardiovascular disease risk.},

abstract = {To examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (N = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study. Physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the Computer Science Applications (CSA) accelerometer. Day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min-1.d-1, ct.d-1) and time (min.d-1) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (1952 ct). Random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80 {\%} reliability were estimated. Physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and Saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. Inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60 {\%} of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. Differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45 {\%} of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8 {\%}. For activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80 {\%} reliability. Reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring. These findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.},

abstract = {Obesity bias is the tendency to negatively judge an overweight or obese individual based on assumed and/or false character traits, such as being physically unattractive, incompetent, lazy and lacking self-discipline. Obesity biases, such as teasing or weight criticism during physical activity (PA), can be psychologically or emotionally damaging for overweight children and adolescents. Ultimately, the effects students experience over time may create a psychological barrier and students can become resistant to schools' health and PA interventions that promote lifestyle changes. Fortunately, the psychological effects of obesity bias are mediated by social buffers and coping mechanisms. Several PA-related researchers have proposed strategic intervention components, but no studies have been completed in PA settings. The purpose of this review was to discuss the nature and different types of obesity bias in PA settings. Major theoretical frameworks of the aetiology and change mechanisms of obesity biases from the psychological literature were reviewed and direct applications for strategic component interventions were made for PA settings. Because of the pervasiveness and entrenchment of obesity bias, it is obvious that multiple theoretical frameworks need to be considered and even combined to create safe and caring school PA environments for students.},

abstract = {Mobile phones and devices, with their constant presence, data connectivity, and multiple intrinsic sensors, can support around-the-clock chronic disease prevention and management that is integrated with daily life. These mobile health (mHealth) devices can produce tremendous amounts of location-rich, real-time, high-frequency data. Unfortunately, these data are often full of bias, noise, variability, and gaps. Robust tools and techniques have not yet been developed to make mHealth data more meaningful to patients and clinicians. To be most useful, health data should be sharable across multiple mHealth applications and connected to electronic health records. The lack of data sharing and dearth of tools and techniques for making sense of health data are critical bottlenecks limiting the impact of mHealth to improve health outcomes. We describe Open mHealth, a nonprofit organization that is building an open software architecture to address these data sharing and "sense-making" bottlenecks. Our architecture consists of open source software modules with well-defined interfaces using a minimal set of common metadata. An initial set of modules, called InfoVis, has been developed for data analysis and visualization. A second set of modules, our Personal Evidence Architecture, will support scientific inferences from mHealth data. These Personal Evidence Architecture modules will include standardized, validated clinical measures to support novel evaluation methods, such as n-of-1 studies. All of Open mHealth's modules are designed to be reusable across multiple applications, disease conditions, and user populations to maximize impact and flexibility. We are also building an open community of developers and health innovators, modeled after the open approach taken in the initial growth of the Internet, to foster meaningful cross-disciplinary collaboration around new tools and techniques. An open mHealth community and architecture will catalyze increased mHealth efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Policies now recommend afterschool programs (ASP, 3-6pm) provide children a minimum amount of physical activity daily. We examined the extent to which children attending ASPs meet existing national and state-level policies that specify expected levels of physical activity (PA). METHODS: Accelerometer-derived physical activity (light and moderate-to-vigorous, MVPA) of 253 children (5-13yrs) was compared to policies that recommend varying amounts of PA children should achieve during an ASP. RESULTS: The proportion of children achieving a policy ranged from 0.0{\%} (California 60min MVPA and North Carolina 20{\%} of daily program time devoted to MVPA), 1.2{\%} (California 30min MVPA), to 48.2{\%} (National Afterschool Association 30min light plus MVPA). Random effects logistic models indicated boys (odds ratio [OR] range 2.0 to 6.27) and children from a minority background (Black/Hispanic, OR range 1.87 to 3.98) were more likely to achieve a recommended level of physical activity, in comparison to girls and White children. Neither age nor BMI were related to achieving a policy. CONCLUSIONS: The PA of children attending ASP falls below policy recommended levels; however, these policies were developed in absence of data on expected PA levels during ASPs. Thus, concerted effort towards building a stronger ASP evidence-base for policy refinement is required.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pedometers are considered desirable devices for monitoring physical activity. Two population groups of interest include patients having undergone surgery in the lower extremities or who are otherwise weakened through disease, medical treatment, or surgery procedures, as well as the slow walking senior population. For these population groups, pedometers must be able to perform reliably and accurately at slow walking speeds. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the step count accuracy of three commercially available pedometers, the Yamax (Tokyo, Japan) Digi-Walker(®) SW-200 (YM), the Omron (Kyoto, Japan) HJ-720 (OM), and the Fitbit (San Francisco, CA) Zip (FB), at slow walking speeds, specifically at 1, 2, and 3 km/h, and to raise awareness of the necessity of focusing research on step-counting devices and algorithms for slow walking populations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen participants 29.93 ±4.93 years of age were requested to walk on a treadmill at the three specified speeds, in four trials of 100 steps each. The devices were worn by the participants on the waist belt. The pedometer counts were recorded, and the error percentage was calculated.

RESULTS: The error rate of all three evaluated pedometers decreased with the increase of speed: at 1 km/h the error rates varied from 87.11{\%} (YM) to 95.98{\%} (FB), at 2 km/h the error rates varied from 17.27{\%} (FB) to 46.46{\%} (YM), and at 3 km/h the error rates varied from 22.46{\%} (YM) to a slight overcount of 0.70{\%} (FB).

CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that all the evaluated devices have high error rates at 1 km/h and mixed error rates at 2 km/h, and at 3 km/h the error rates are the smallest of the three assessed speeds, with the OM and the FB having a slight overcount. These results show that research on pedometers' software and hardware should focus more on accurate step detection at slow walking speeds.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A knowledge of how young people use their time could be instrumental in informing health interventions, modeling consumer behaviors, and planning service delivery. The aim of the present study was to describe age- and gender-related patterns in the self-reported use of time on school days in a large sample of Australian children and adolescents aged between 10 and 18 years. METHODS: A single, detailed use-of-time diary for a school day was collected from 6024 Australians aged 10-18 from several state and regional surveys conducted in the states of South Australia (SA) and Victoria between 2001 and 2006. Time-use profiles were analyzed for a range of active and sedentary state behaviors. RESULTS: Boys reported higher physical activity levels (PALs), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and sports than girls. There were no differences in free play, and girls used more active transport. All activity-related variables decreased with age, except active transport, which peaked at 14-15 years. Boys exhibited higher levels of screen time, whereas girls had higher levels of passive transport. Screen time and its components (television, videogames, and computer use) peaked in the peripubertal years. CONCLUSION: Age- and gender-related patterns of time use vary greatly within adolescence. This may reflect a mix of biological and social factors.},

METHODS: Forty healthy volunteers wearing all accelerometers undertook either five treadmill walks (n=20) at speeds ranging between 0.6-1.4m/s or a 15min motor vehicle journey (n=20). Step counts recorded by each accelerometer were compared to the actual step count determined by video analysis (treadmill walking) or to an actual step count of zero (motor vehicle). Mean percentage measurement error was calculated and compared between devices by one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test. RESULTS: For treadmill walking, the measurement error was lowest for the ActivPAL, with no significant differences between the ActivPAL and the PALlite monitors. The measurement error was significantly higher for the Digi-Walker at speeds of </=1m/s. During vehicle travel erroneous steps were recorded by the PALlite (254 steps) and Digi-Walker (25 steps), but not the AcitvPAL monitor (0 steps). CONCLUSIONS: The ActivPAL accelerometer accurately measures step count over a range of walking speeds and, unlike the other accelerometers tested, is not falsely triggered by motor vehicle travel.},

abstract = {Approximately one-third of adults in the United States are physically inactive. This is a significant public health concern as physical activity (PA) can influence the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain forms of cancer. To minimize these health risks, effective PA interventions must be developed and disseminated to the vast number of individuals who remain sedentary. Smartphone technology presents an exciting opportunity for delivering PA interventions remotely. Although a number of PA applications are currently available for smartphones, these "apps" are not based on established theories of health behavior change and most do not include evidence-based features (e.g., reinforcement and goal setting). Our aim was to collect formative data to develop a smartphone PA app that is empirically and theoretically-based and incorporates user preferences. We recruited 15 sedentary adults to test three currently available PA smartphone apps and provide qualitative and quantitative feedback. Findings indicate that users have a number of specific preferences with regard to PA app features, including that apps provide automatic tracking of PA (e.g., steps taken and calories burned), track progress toward PA goals, and integrate a music feature. Participants also preferred that PA apps be flexible enough to be used with several types of PA, and have well-documented features and user-friendly interfaces (e.g., a one-click main page). When queried by the researcher, most participants endorsed including goal-setting and problem-solving features. These findings provide a blue print for developing a smartphone PA app that incorporates evidence-based components and user preferences.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolving concepts of pervasive computing, ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence are increasingly influencing health care and medicine. Summarizing published research, this literature review provides an overview of recent developments and implementations of pervasive computing systems in health care. It also highlights some of the experiences reported in deployment processes. METHODS: There is no clear definition of pervasive computing in the current literature. Thus specific inclusion criteria for selecting articles about relevant systems were developed. Searches were conducted in four scientific databases alongside manual journal searches for the period of 2002 to 2006. Articles included present prototypes, case studies and pilot studies, clinical trials and systems that are already in routine use. RESULTS: The searches identified 69 articles describing 67 different systems. In a quantitative analysis, these systems were categorized into project status, health care settings, user groups, improvement aims, and systems features (i.e., component types, data gathering, data transmission, systems functions). The focus is on the types of systems implemented, their frequency of occurrence and their characteristics. Qualitative analyses were performed of deployment issues, such as organizational and personnel issues, privacy and security issues, and financial issues. This paper provides a comprehensive access to the literature of the emerging field by addressing specific topics of application settings, systems features, and deployment experiences. CONCLUSION: Both an overview and an analysis of the literature on a broad and heterogeneous range of systems are provided. Most systems are described in their prototype stages. Deployment issues, such as implications on organization or personnel, privacy concerns, or financial issues are mentioned rarely, though their solution is regarded as decisive in transferring promising systems to a stage of regular operation. There is a need for further research on the deployment of pervasive computing systems, including clinical studies, economic and social analyses, user studies, etc.},

abstract = {The obesity epidemic is attributed in part to reduced physical activity. Evidence supports that reducing time spent sitting, regardless of activity, may improve the metabolic consequences of obesity. Analyses were conducted in a large prospective study of US adults enrolled by the American Cancer Society to examine leisure time spent sitting and physical activity in relation to mortality. Time spent sitting and physical activity were queried by questionnaire on 53,440 men and 69,776 women who were disease free at enrollment. The authors identified 11,307 deaths in men and 7,923 deaths in women during the 14-year follow-up. After adjustment for smoking, body mass index, and other factors, time spent sitting ([{\&}ge;]6 vs. <3 hours/day) was associated with mortality in both women (relative risk = 1.34, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.44) and men (relative risk = 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.11, 1.24). Relative risks for sitting ([{\&}ge;]6 hours/day) and physical activity (<24.5 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week) combined were 1.94 (95{\%} CI: 1.70, 2.20) for women and 1.48 (95{\%} CI: 1.33, 1.65) for men, compared with those with the least time sitting and most activity. Associations were strongest for cardiovascular disease mortality. The time spent sitting was independently associated with total mortality, regardless of physical activity level. Public health messages should include both being physically active and reducing time spent sitting.},

Consequently, we are seeing the growth of data collection experiments in several scientific disciplines. Although these have yielded promising results, mobile and wearable data collection experiments are often restricted to a specific configuration that has been designed for a unique study goal. These approaches do not address all the real-world challenges of “continuous data collection” systems. As a result, there have been few discussions or reports about such issues that are faced when “implementing these platforms” in a practical situation. To address this, we have summarized our technical and user-centric findings from three lifelogging and Quantified Self data collection studies, which we have conducted in real-world settings, for both smartphones and smartwatches. In addition to (i) privacy and (ii) battery related issues; based on our findings we recommend further works to consider (iii) implementing multivariate reflection of the data; (iv) resolving the uncertainty and data loss; and (v) consider to minimize the manual intervention required by users. These findings have provided insights that can be used as a guideline for further Quantified Self or lifelogging studies.},

(1) The over burdened health care system will face a worldwide wave of retirees who will live longer, cost more to treat, and demand new goods and services to help them stay healthy, active, and independent. Research in persuasive technologies and the associated usage of a computing system, device, or application intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior in a predetermined way is showing the potential to assist in improving healthy living, reduce the costs on the health care system, and allow the aged to maintain a more independent life. This article gives a deeper insight into the evolution of persuasive technologies and presents a framework that can guide a researcher or practitioner in comprehending more effectively the work being done in this novel research field. It also provides categories of domains within health care in which these technologies are used and surveys exemplars from published literature. The article's goal is to provide greater understanding by addressing the challenges that lie ahead for all key stakeholders that design and/or use persuasive technologies in health care.},

This paper explores personal analytics from the perspective of self-optimization, arguing that the ways in which people confront and engage with visualized personal data are as significant as the technology itself. The paper leans on the concept of the “data double”: the conversion of human bodies and minds into data flows that can be figuratively reassembled for the purposes of personal reflection and interaction. Based on an empirical study focusing on heart-rate variability measurement, the discussion underlines that a distanced theorizing of personal analytics is not sufficient if one wants to capture affective encounters between humans and their data doubles. Research outcomes suggest that these explanations can produce permanence and stability while also profoundly changing ways in which people reflect on themselves, on others and on their daily lives.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: This paper 1) provides the calibration procedures and methods for metabolic and activity monitor data collection, 2) compares measured MET values to the MET values from the Compendium of Physical Activities, and 3) examines the relationship between accelerometer output and METs for a range of physical activities METHODS:: Participants (n=277) completed 11 activities for seven minutes each from a menu of 23 physical activities. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured using a portable metabolic system and an accelerometer was worn. MET values were defined as follows; measuredMETs (VO2/measured RMR) and standardMETs (VO2/3.5ml.kg.min). For the total sample and by sub-group (age [young <40y], sex and BMI [normal-weight <25 kg.m]), measuredMETs and standardMETs were compared to the Compendium, using 95{\%} confidence intervals to determine statistical significance (alpha=0.05). Average count.min for each activity and the linear association between count.min and METs are presented. RESULTS:: Compendium METs were different than measured METs for 17/21 activities (81{\%}). The number of activities different than the Compendium were similar between sub-groups or when standard METs were used. The average counts for the activities ranged from 11 counts.min(dishes) to 7490 counts.min (2.23m.s, 3{\%}) The r between counts and METs was 0.65. CONCLUSIONS:: This study provides valuable information about data collection, metabolic responses, and accelerometer output for common physical activities in a diverse participant sample. The Compendium should be updated with additional empirical data and linear regression models are inappropriate for accurately predicting METs from accelerometer output.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and correlates of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior among immigrant and US-born children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health, a telephone survey conducted between January 29, 2003, and July 1, 2004. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Multivariate logistic and least squares regression models were used to analyze immigrant differentials among 68 288 children aged 6 through 17 years. Main Exposure Ethnic-immigrant status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and odds of regular physical activity, inactivity, television watching, and lack of sports participation. RESULTS: Physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic-immigrant groups. For example, 22.5{\%} of immigrant Hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9.5{\%} of US-born white children with US-born parents. Approximately 67{\%} of immigrant Hispanic children did not participate in sports compared with 30.2{\%} of native Asian children. Overall, immigrant children were significantly more likely to be physically inactive and less likely to participate in sports than native children; they were, however, less likely to watch television 3 or more hours per day than native children, although the nativity gap narrowed with increasing acculturation levels. Compared with native white children, the adjusted odds of physical inactivity and lack of sports participation were both 2 times higher for immigrant Hispanic children with foreign-born parents, and the odds of television watching were 1.5 and 2.3 times higher for native Hispanic and black children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrant children in each ethnic minority group generally had higher physical inactivity and lower sports participation levels than native children. To reduce disparities, health education programs need to promote physical activity among children in immigrant families.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Current methods of assessing routes taken during active transport rely on subjective recall of trip length and barriers encountered enroute or the utilization of objective measures (Geographic Information Systems -[GIS]) that may not represent actual travel patterns. This study examined the utility of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to measure actual routes taken compared with GIS-estimated travel distance and barriers encountered. METHODS: Comparisons between GPS and GIS routes were performed for 59 of 75 children who wore a GPS during the journey to school on a single occasion. Home and school addresses were reported by parents and geocoded in GIS. Children were provided with a GPS and were instructed to travel their normal route to and from school. Data were collected between March and November 2005 and exported to the GIS to determine travel distance, number of busy streets crossed, and the ratio of busy streets to the total streets traveled on. Data analysis was performed in August 2006. RESULTS: No differences were observed between GPS-measured journeys to and from school on any of the examined variables. No differences were observed between GIS and GPS measures of travel distance (p>0.05). GIS-estimated travel routes crossed a significantly (p<0.05) higher number of busy streets (GIS: 1.68+/-0.12 vs GPS: 1.19+/-0.11) and traveled on a higher ratio of busy streets to total streets traveled on (GIS: 0.46+/-0.03 vs GPS: 0.35+/-0.04) (p<0.05) compared with GPS-measured actual travel routes. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic Information Systems provides estimates of travel distance similar to GPS-measured actual travel distances. Travel routes estimated by GIS are not representative of actual routes measured by GPS, which indicates that GIS may not provide an accurate estimate of barriers encountered. The continued use of GPS in active transport research in encouraged.},

abstract = {Background
          The true causes of the obesity epidemic are not well understood and there are few longitudinal population-based data published examining this issue. The objective of this analysis was to examine trends in occupational physical activity during the past 5 decades and explore how these trends relate to concurrent changes in body weight in the U.S.
        
        
          Methodology/Principal Findings
          Analysis of energy expenditure for occupations in U.S. private industry since 1960 using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mean body weight was derived from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). In the early 1960's almost half the jobs in private industry in the U.S. required at least moderate intensity physical activity whereas now less than 20{\%} demand this level of energy expenditure. Since 1960 the estimated mean daily energy expenditure due to work related physical activity has dropped by more than 100 calories in both women and men. Energy balance model predicted weights based on change in occupation-related daily energy expenditure since 1960 for each NHANES examination period closely matched the actual change in weight for 40–50 year old men and women. For example from 1960–62 to 2003–06 we estimated that the occupation-related daily energy expenditure decreased by 142 calories in men. Given a baseline weight of 76.9 kg in 1960–02, we estimated that a 142 calories reduction would result in an increase in mean weight to 89.7 kg, which closely matched the mean NHANES weight of 91.8 kg in 2003–06. The results were similar for women.
        
        
          Conclusion
          Over the last 50 years in the U.S. we estimate that daily occupation-related energy expenditure has decreased by more than 100 calories, and this reduction in energy expenditure accounts for a significant portion of the increase in mean U.S. body weights for women and men.},

abstract = {A growing number of information technology systems and services are being developed to change users attitudes or behavior or both. Despite the fact that attitudinal theories from social psychology have been quite extensively applied to the study of user intentions and behavior, these theories have been developed for predicting user acceptance of the information technology rather than for providing systematic analysis and design methods for developing persuasive software solutions. This article is conceptual and theory-creating by its nature, suggesting a framework for Persuasive Systems Design (PSD). It discusses the process of designing and evaluating persuasive systems and describes what kind of content and software functionality may be found in the final product. It also highlights seven underlying postulates behind persuasive systems and ways to analyze the persuasion context (the intent, the event, and the strategy). The article further lists 28 design principles for persuasive system content and functionality, describing example software requirements and implementations. Some of the design principles are novel. Moreover, a new categorization of these principles is proposed, consisting of the primary task, dialogue, system credibility, and social support categories.},

abstract = {Conventional antipsychotic drugs, used for a half century to treat a range of major psychiatric disorders, are being replaced in clinical practice by modern "atypical" antipsychotics, including aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone among others. As a class, the newer drugs have been promoted as being broadly clinically superior, but the evidence for this is problematic. In this brief critical overview, we consider the pharmacology, therapeutic effectiveness, tolerability, adverse effects and costs of individual modern agents versus older antipsychotic drugs. Because of typically minor differences between agents in clinical effectiveness and tolerability, and because of growing concerns about potential adverse long-term health consequences of some modern agents, it is reasonable to consider both older and newer drugs for clinical use, and it is important to inform patients of relative benefits, risks and costs of specific choices.},

@article{Akar2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend using remote patient monitoring (RPM) for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, but the patterns of adoption of this technology have not been described. Successful use of RPM depends on (1) the enrollment of the patient into an RPM system and (2) subsequent activation of RPM by the enrolled patient. We examined RPM enrollment and activation rates and the patient, physician, and institutional determinants of RPM use.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Information about the use of RPM-capable devices was obtained from the Boston Scientific Corporation ALTITUDE program and linked to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry. Patients were first categorized as RPM-enrolled and RPM-not enrolled, and the RPM-enrolled patients were further categorized into RPM-active and RPM-inactive groups based on whether they transmitted RPM data. Variables associated with RPM enrollment and activation were identified with the use of multivariable logistic regression. Among 39 158 patients with newly implanted RPM-capable devices, 62{\%} (n=24 113) were RPM-enrolled. Of those enrolled, 76{\%} (n=18 289, or 47{\%} of the entire cohort) activated their device. RPM enrollment was highly variable among institutions. The hospital-specific median odds ratio for RPM enrollment was 3.43, signifying that physician or institutional factors are associated with RPM enrollment. In contrast, the hospital-specific median odds ratio for RPM activation was 1.69. Age, race, health insurance, geographic location, and health-related factors were similarly associated with both RPM enrollment and activation.

CONCLUSIONS: RPM technology is used in less than half of eligible patients. Lack of enrollment into RPM systems is the major cause of underutilization, and this primarily relates to the local practice environment.},

In this study, 11 healthy adults wore Fitbit accelerometers for 3 weeks. During the initial baseline, subjects earned prize draws for wearing the Fitbit. During intervention, percentile schedules were used to calculate individual prize-draw criteria. The final week was a return to baseline. Four subjects increased step counts as a result of the intervention. A bout analysis of interresponse times revealed that subjects increased overall step counts by increasing daily minutes active and within-bout response rates and decreasing pauses between bouts of activity. Strategies to improve effectiveness are suggested, such as modification of reinforcement probability and amount and identification of the function of periods of inactivity.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in the relation of built environments to physical activity, obesity, and other health outcomes. The purpose of the present study was to test associations of neighborhood built environment and median income to multiple health outcomes and examine whether associations are similar for low- and high-income groups. This was a cross-sectional study of 32 neighborhoods in Seattle, WA and Baltimore, MD regions, stratified by income and walkability, and conducted between 2001 and 2005. Participants were adults aged 20-65years (n=2199; 26{\%} ethnic minority). The main outcomes were daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) from accelerometer monitoring, body mass index (BMI) based on self-report, and mental and physical quality of life (QoL) assessed with the SF-12. We found that MVPA was higher in high- vs. low-walkability neighborhoods but did not differ by neighborhood income. Overweight/obesity (BMI > or = 25) was lower in high-walkability neighborhoods. Physical QoL was higher in high-income neighborhoods but unrelated to walkability. Adjustment for neighborhood self-selection produced minor changes. We concluded that living in walkable neighborhoods was associated with more physical activity and lower overweight/obesity but not with other benefits. Lower- and higher-income groups benefited similarly from living in high-walkability neighborhoods. Adults in higher-income neighborhoods had lower BMI and higher physical QoL.},

abstract = {Time spent watching television has been linked to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, all conditions characterized to some degree by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. However, limited evidence relates screen time (watching television or using a computer) directly to concentrations of insulin. We examined the cross-sectional associations between time spent watching television or using a computer, physical activity, and serum concentrations of insulin using data from 2800 participants aged at least 20 years of the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The amount of time spent watching television and using a computer as well as physical activity was self-reported. The unadjusted geometric mean concentration of insulin increased from 6.2 muU/mL among participants who did not watch television to 10.0 muU/mL among those who watched television for 5 or more hours per day (P = .001). After adjustment for age, sex, race or ethnicity, educational status, concentration of cotinine, alcohol intake, physical activity, waist circumference, and body mass index using multiple linear regression analysis, the log-transformed concentrations of insulin were significantly and positively associated with time spent watching television (P = < .001). Reported time spent using a computer was significantly associated with log-transformed concentrations of insulin before but not after accounting for waist circumference and body mass index. Leisure-time physical activity but not transportation or household physical activity was significantly and inversely associated with log-transformed concentrations of insulin. Sedentary behavior, particularly the amount of time spent watching television, may be an important modifiable determinant of concentrations of insulin.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: More than one-third of adults and 17{\%} of youth in the United States are obese, although the prevalence remained stable between 2003-2004 and 2009-2010.

OBJECTIVE: To provide the most recent national estimates of childhood obesity, analyze trends in childhood obesity between 2003 and 2012, and provide detailed obesity trend analyses among adults.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Weight and height or recumbent length were measured in 9120 participants in the 2011-2012 nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In infants and toddlers from birth to 2 years, high weight for recumbent length was defined as weight for length at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. In children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific CDC BMI-for-age growth charts. In adults, obesity was defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 30. Analyses of trends in high weight for recumbent length or obesity prevalence were conducted overall and separately by age across 5 periods (2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012).

RESULTS: In 2011-2012, 8.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 5.8{\%}-11.1{\%}) of infants and toddlers had high weight for recumbent length, and 16.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 14.9{\%}-19.2{\%}) of 2- to 19-year-olds and 34.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 32.0{\%}-37.9{\%}) of adults (age-adjusted) aged 20 years or older were obese. Overall, there was no significant change from 2003-2004 through 2011-2012 in high weight for recumbent length among infants and toddlers, obesity in 2- to 19-year-olds, or obesity in adults. Tests for an interaction between survey period and age found an interaction in children (P = .03) and women (P = .02). There was a significant decrease in obesity among 2- to 5-year-old children (from 13.9{\%} to 8.4{\%}; P = .03) and a significant increase in obesity among women aged 60 years and older (from 31.5{\%} to 38.1{\%}; P = .006).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall, there have been no significant changes in obesity prevalence in youth or adults between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. Obesity prevalence remains high and thus it is important to continue surveillance.},

abstract = {This study investigated associations between components of physical activity (PA; e.g. domain and social context) and sedentary behaviors (SBs) and risk of depression in women from disadvantaged neighborhoods. A total of 3645 women, aged 18-45 years, from disadvantaged neighborhoods, self-reported their PA, SB and depressive symptoms. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals were calculated for each component of PA, SB and risk of depression using logistic regression analyses, adjusting for clustering by women's neighborhood of residence. Being in a higher tertile of leisure-time PA and transport-related PA was associated with lower risk of depression. No associations were apparent for domestic or work-related PA. Women who undertook a small proportion of their leisure-time PA with someone were less likely to be at risk of depression than those who undertook all leisure-time PA on their own. Women reporting greater time sitting at the computer, screen time and overall sitting time had higher odds of risk of depression compared with those reporting low levels. The domain and social context of PA may be important components in reducing the risk of depression. Reducing time spent in SB may be a key strategy in the promotion of better mental health in women from disadvantaged neighborhoods.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between physical activity and inactivity patterns and overweight in U.S. adolescents using baseline and 1-year change in activity and inactivity data. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Nationally representative data from 12,759 participants (6997 non-Hispanic whites, 2676 non-Hispanic blacks, 2185 Hispanics, and 901 Asians) in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995 and 1996). Data on moderate to vigorous and low-intensity physical activity, TV/video viewing, and video game/computer use were obtained from questionnaires. Multivariate models assessed the association of overweight (body mass index > or = 95th percentile Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics 2000 curves) with initial (and 1-year change) activity and inactivity levels, controlling for age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, urban residence, cigarette smoking, and region of residence. RESULTS: Overweight prevalence was positively associated with high level TV/video viewing among white boys (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52; 95{\%} confidence interval [1.08 to 2.14]) and girls (OR = 2.45 [1.51 to 3.97]). The odds of overweight decreased with high levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity among white boys (OR = 0.81 [0.76 to 0.87]), non-Hispanic black boys (OR = 0.86 [0.76 to 0.98]) and girls (OR = 0.88 [0.78 to 0.99]), and Hispanic boys (OR = 0.90 [0.83 to 0.97]) and girls (OR = 0.91 [0.84 to 0.99]). DISCUSSION: Predicted probabilities generated from the logistic regression models, which examined the experimental effects of altering hours of TV/video viewing and bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity, show lower overweight among adolescents who watched less TV per week combined with frequent moderate to vigorous physical activity than those who watched more TV per week combined with fewer bouts of weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity. Predicted probabilities suggest important sex and ethnic differences in these associations.},

METHODS: Associations were examined in five regions using two Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) countries from each. RESULTS: Self-reported psychological and social health indices such as self-image, perceived health status, and Life Satisfaction were positively related to PA in all five regions but, with a few exceptions, negatively related to SBM. Negative health indices such as health complaints and tobacco use were negatively related to PA but, with exceptions, positively related to SBM. Significant regional differences were present. CONCLUSIONS: Regional differences in correlates of PA and SBM suggest cultural differences in potential effects of PA and SBM and the need to tailor school and public health efforts to the different meanings of PA and SBM for positive and negative health consequences.},

@article{Marshall2009b,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is a public health recommendation to accumulate at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity. Although pedometers are widely used as a physical activity-monitoring tool, they are unable to measure activity intensity. Translating current physical activity recommendations into a pedometer-based guideline could increase the public health impact of physical activity interventions.

METHODS: A community sample of 97 adults (60{\%} women, with a mean age of 32.1 [+/-10.6] years and a mean BMI of 28.8 [+/-5.5]) completed four 6-minute incremental walking bouts on a level treadmill at 65, 80, 95, and 110 m x min(-1). A calibrated metabolic cart was used to measure energy expenditure at each speed. Steps were measured using a Yamax SW-200 pedometer. Step-rate cut points associated with minimally moderate-intensity activity (defined as 3 METs) were determined using multiple regression, mixed modeling, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. All data were collected and analyzed in 2006.

RESULTS: For men, step counts per minute associated with walking at 3 METs were 92 step x min(-1) (multiple regression); 101 step x min(-1) (mixed modeling); and 102 step x min(-1) (ROC curve). For women, step counts per minute associated with walking at 3 METs were 91 step x min(-1) (multiple regression); 111 step x min(-1) (mixed modeling); and 115 step x min(-1) (ROC curve). However, for each analysis there was substantial error in model fit.

CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-intensity walking appears approximately equal to at least 100 step x min(-1). However, step counts per minute is a poor proxy for METs, and so 100 step x min(-1) should be used only as a general physical activity promotion heuristic. To meet current guidelines, individuals are encouraged to walk a minimum of 3000 steps in 30 minutes on 5 days each week. Three bouts of 1000 steps in 10 minutes each day can also be used to meet the recommended goal.},

abstract = {Dietary intervention trials aim to change dietary patterns of individuals. Participating in such trials could impact dietary self-report in divergent ways: Dietary counseling and training on portion-size estimation could improve self-report accuracy; participant burden could increase systematic error. Such intervention-associated biases could complicate interpretation of trial results. The authors investigated intervention-associated biases in reported total carotenoid intake using data on 3,088 breast cancer survivors recruited between 1995 and 2000 and followed through 2006 in the Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study, a randomized intervention trial. Longitudinal data from 2 self-report methods (24-hour recalls and food frequency questionnaires) and a plasma carotenoid biomarker were collected. A flexible measurement error model was postulated. Parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework by using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Results indicated that the validity (i.e., correlation with "true" intake) of both self-report methods was significantly higher during follow-up for intervention versus nonintervention participants (4-year validity estimates: intervention = 0.57 for food frequency questionnaires and 0.58 for 24-hour recalls; nonintervention = 0.42 for food frequency questionnaires and 0.48 for 24-hour recalls). However, within- and between-instrument error correlations during follow-up were higher among intervention participants, indicating an increase in systematic error. Diet interventions can impact measurement errors of dietary self-report. Appropriate statistical methods should be applied to examine intervention-associated biases when interpreting results of diet trials.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore mean food group intakes associated with central obesity anthropometry among children and adolescents enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Representative sampling of the US population (1998-2002). SUBJECTS: Subjects were 3761 children (5-11 years) and 1803 adolescents (12-16 years) with single 24 h dietary recalls and anthropometric measures of central body fat (waist circumference and sum of subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses). RESULTS: Results were controlled for confounding by age, height, race/ethnicity, Tanner stage, television viewing and parental education. In younger children, there was no relationship between central adiposity and mean intakes of dairy, fruit, vegetables or grains, while a positive association with meat intake was found among boys. In adolescent boys and girls, central body fat measures were inversely associated with mean dairy and grain intakes. Adolescent boys in the highest quartile of central adiposity consumed less fruit and fewer vegetables; those in the lowest central adiposity quartile consumed less meat. Finally, adolescents who met the criteria for central obesity (waist circumference >or=85th percentile for age and sex) reported consuming significantly less total dairy (as well as milk and cheese separately), total grains (whole and refined) and total fruit and vegetables. There was no association with meat consumption. To test the stability of these findings, the final analysis was replicated in 2541 same-aged adolescents from NHANES 1999-2002; the results were very similar. CONCLUSIONS: These cross-sectional analyses suggest that intakes of dairy, grains and total fruits and vegetables are inversely associated with central obesity among adolescents.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity is a risk factor for lipoprotein disorders and the metabolic syndrome. Physical inactivity has a powerful effect on suppressing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in skeletal muscle, the rate-limiting enzyme for hydrolysis of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. We tested the ability of several compounds to prevent the decrease in LPL. The present study minimized standing and ordinary light nonexercise movements in rats to compare the effects of inactivity and nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) on LPL activity. The key new insight was that the typically quick decrease in LPL activity of oxidative muscle caused by physical inactivity was prevented by nicotinic acid (NA), whereas inhibitors of TNF-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and NF-kappaB had no such effect. NA was administered at a dose known to acutely impede the appearance of plasma TG from the liver and free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and it was effective at intentionally lowering plasma lipid concentrations to the same level in active and inactive groups. As measured from heparin-releasable LPL activity, LPL in the microvasculature of the most oxidative muscles was approximately 90{\%} lower in the inactive group compared with controls, and this suppression was completely blocked by NA. In contrast to inactivity, NA did not raise muscle LPL in ambulatory controls, whereas a large exogenous fat delivery did decrease LPL activity. In vitro control studies revealed that NA did not have a direct effect on skeletal muscle LPL activity. In conclusion, physical inactivity amplifies the ability of plasma lipids to suppress muscle LPL activity. The light ambulatory contractions responsible for NEAT are sufficient for mitigating these deleterious effects.},

This study aimed to assess the feasibility of combining GPS, GIS, and accelerometry to understand transport-related physical activity (TPA) in adults. METHODS: Forty adults wore an accelerometer and portable GPS unit over 7 consecutive days and completed a demographics questionnaire and 7-day travel log. Accelerometer and GPS data were extracted for commutes to/from workplace and integrated into a GIS database. GIS maps were generated to visually explore physical activity intensity, GPS speeds and routes traveled. RESULTS: GPS, accelerometer, and survey data were collected for 37 participants. Loss of GPS data was substantial due to a range of methodological issues, such as low battery life, signal drop out, and participant noncompliance. Nonetheless, greater travel distances and significantly higher speeds were observed for motorized trips when compared with TPA. CONCLUSIONS: Pragmatic issues of using GPS monitoring to understand TPA behaviors and methodological recommendations for future research were identified. Although methodologically challenging, the combination of GPS monitoring, accelerometry and GIS technologies holds promise for understanding TPA within the built environment.},

Questionnaires were administered post-implementation and in the fall and spring of each year. Outcomes were dose, acceptability, feasibility, and intent to continue use. RESULTS: The average number of lessons taught per teacher per year was 1.7 to 3.1, compared to a goal of 2 to 3. Each year, teachers reported high acceptability and perceived feasibility of the intervention, and the majority indicated they intended to continue using the curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Planet Health was feasible and acceptable in a participatory research model involving a public school-university partnership, and it was also sustainable independent of the research effort.},

abstract = {Mobile fitness trackers are increasingly used by patients as a means to become more involved in their own self-care; however, these devices measure disparate outcomes that may have equivocal relevance to true health status. It is vital for physicians to interpret both the quality and accuracy of the information that these trackers provide, and it is important to delineate which role, if any, these devices may serve in promoting quality patient care in the future. Potential benefits of mobile fitness trackers include the ability to motivate patients toward a healthier lifestyle, to develop a community of like-minded individuals seeking to improve their health, as well as to create an environment of sustainability and accountability for long-term promotion of health maintenance. However, limitations include the fact that mobile fitness trackers are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, that the employed metrics are not necessarily the best surrogates for true health status, and that the accuracy of measured endpoints has not yet been proven. As mobile fitness trackers both continue to rise in popularity and become increasingly sophisticated, physicians must be equipped to interpret and use this technology to better serve patients within an ever-changing, more technology-reliant health care system.},

abstract = {Background The aims of this study were to examine what amount of sedentary time is associated with low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in adolescents and whether this association is independent of physical activity. Methods The study comprised 1808 adolescents aged 12.5-17.5 years from 10 European cities. Sedentary time and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were measured by accelerometer. CRF was assessed by the 20 m shuttle-run test. Adolescents were divided into two groups (high/low) according to FITNESSGRAM guidelines. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine thresholds that best discriminate between high and low CRF in adolescents. Results Adolescent girls had more sedentary time than boys (p<0.001). ROC analysis showed that girls spending ≥69{\%} of waking time in sedentary activities had low CRF, but no significant threshold discriminated between high and low CRF in boys. Adolescent girls who exceeded this threshold had lower levels of CRF (p≤0.001) and were more likely to have a low CRF (OR 1.68, 95{\%} CI 1.22 to 2.31) independent of centre, age and body mass index. The negative influence of excessive sedentary time on CRF remained significant (p=0.045) in adolescent girls who did not meet the physical activity guidelines (<60 min/day in MVPA) but was abolished (p>0.05) in those who met the recommendation (≥60 min/day in MVPA). Conclusion Excessive sedentary time is associated with low CRF in adolescent girls but not in boys. However, this adverse effect might be attenuated if adolescent girls meet the current physical activity guidelines.},

abstract = {Much progress has been made in the past 5 to 10 years in measuring and understanding the impact of the food and physical activity environments on behavioral outcomes. Nevertheless, this research is in its infancy. A work group was convened to identify current evidence gaps and barriers in food and physical activity environments and policy research measures, and develop recommendations to guide future directions for measurement and methodologic research efforts. A nominal group process was used to determine six priority areas for food and physical activity environments and policy measures to move the field forward by 2015, including: (1) identify relevant factors in the food and physical activity environments to measure, including those most amenable to change; (2) improve understanding of mechanisms for relationships between the environment and physical activity, diet, and obesity; (3) develop simplified measures that are sensitive to change, valid for different population groups and settings, and responsive to changing trends; (4) evaluate natural experiments to improve understanding of food and physical activity environments and their impact on behaviors and weight; (5) establish surveillance systems to predict and track change over time; and (6) develop standards for adopting effective health-promoting changes to the food and physical activity environments. The recommendations emanating from the work group highlight actions required to advance policy-relevant research related to food and physical activity environments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimal contact pedometer-based interventions are gaining in popularity as a cost-effective method of promoting physical activity. The experiences of women in these interventions, however, have not been adequately studied.

PURPOSE: This study used focus groups to explore women's experiences in a minimal contact pedometer-based intervention.

METHODS: Participants were women aged 31 to 51 years who completed a 6-week minimal contact pedometer-based intervention. Before the intervention, all participants were inactive or irregularly active. For the intervention, participants wore pedometers, completed weekly logs of daily steps taken, created physical activity goals, and received weekly emails. Email messages contained strategies for increasing physical activity and served as reminders to wear the pedometer and submit the step logs. After the intervention, participants were invited to attend focus groups to discuss their experiences in the intervention. A generic qualitative research approach was used to analyze the data.

RESULTS: Wearing the pedometer helped participants set goals and motivated them to increase their physical activity. Submitting step logs made them accountable. They wanted more innovative tips in the emails for increasing physical activity.

DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that the effectiveness of minimal contact interventions may be enhanced by including pedometers, step logs, and email reminders.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Environmental factors are suggested to play a major role in physical activity (PA) and other obesity-related behaviors, yet there is no national research on the relationship between disparity in access to recreational facilities and additional impact on PA and overweight patterns in US adolescents. OBJECTIVE: In a nationally representative cohort, we sought to assess the geographic and social distribution of PA facilities and how disparity in access might underlie population-level PA and overweight patterns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Residential locations of US adolescents in wave I (1994-1995) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 20745) were geocoded, and a 8.05-km buffer around each residence was drawn (N = 42857 census-block groups [19{\%} of US block groups]). PA facilities, measured by national databases and satellite data, were linked with Geographic Information Systems technology to each respondent. Logistic-regression analyses tested the relationship of PA-related facilities with block-group socioeconomic status (SES) (at the community level) and the subsequent association of facilities with overweight and PA (at the individual level), controlling for population density. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were overweight (BMI > or = 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics growth curves) and achievement of > or = 5 bouts per week of moderate-vigorous PA. RESULTS: Higher-SES block groups had a significantly greater relative odds of having 1 or more facilities. Low-SES and high-minority block groups were less likely to have facilities. Relative to zero facilities per block group, an increasing number of facilities was associated with decreased overweight and increased relative odds of achieving > or = 5 bouts per week of moderate-vigorous PA. CONCLUSIONS: Lower-SES and high-minority block groups had reduced access to facilities, which in turn was associated with decreased PA and increased overweight. Inequality in availability of PA facilities may contribute to ethnic and SES disparities in PA and overweight patterns.},

@article{Chakravarthy2004,
abstract = {Survival of Homo sapiens during evolution was dependent on the procurement of food, which in turn was dependent on physical activity. However, food supply was never consistent. Thus it is contended that the ancient hunter-gatherer had cycles of feast and famine, punctuated with obligate periods of physical activity and rest. Hence, gene selection in the Late-Paleolithic era was probably influenced by physical activity and rest. To ensure survival during periods of famine, certain genes evolved to regulate efficient intake and utilization of fuel stores. Such genes were termed "thrifty genes" in 1962. Furthermore, convincing evidence shows that this ancient genome has remained essentially unchanged over the past 10,000 years and certainly not changed in the past 40-100 years. Although the absolute caloric intake of modern-day humans is likely lower compared with our hunter-gatherer ancestors, it is nevertheless in positive caloric balance in the majority of the US adult population mainly due to the increased sedentary lifestyle in present society. We contend that the combination of continuous food abundance and physical inactivity eliminates the evolutionarily programmed biochemical cycles emanating from feast-famine and physical activity-rest cycles, which in turn abrogates the cycling of certain metabolic processes, ultimately resulting in metabolic derangements such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes. In this context, we postulate that perhaps a crucial mechanism to break the stall of the metabolic processes would be via exercise through the regulation of "physical activity genes," some of which may also be potential candidates for the "thrifty genes" of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Therefore, the identification of such "thrifty gene" candidates would help provide insight into the pathogenetic processes of the numerous physical inactivity-mediated disorders.},

Worksite interventions designed to decrease sedentary time may serve to improve employee health. Objective The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and use of a pedal exercise machine for reducing workplace sedentary time. Methods Eighteen full-time employees (mean age+SD 40.2+10.7 years; 88{\%} female) working in sedentary occupations were recruited for participation. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected at baseline and 4 weeks. Participants were provided access to a pedal exercise machine for 4 weeks at work. Use of the device was measured objectively by exercise tracking software, which monitors pedal activity and provides the user real-time feedback (eg, speed, time, distance, calories). At 4 weeks, participants completed a feasibility questionnaire. Results Participants reported sitting 83{\%} of their working days. Participants used the pedal machines an average of 12.2+6.6 out of a possible 20 working days and pedalled an average of 23.4+20.4 min each day used. Feasibility data indicate that participants found the machines feasible for use at work. Participants also reported sedentary time at work decreased due to the machine. Discussion Findings from this study suggest that this pedal machine may be a feasible tool for reducing sedentary time while at work. These findings hold public health significance due to the growing number of sedentary jobs in the USA and the potential of the device for use in large-scale worksite health programmes.},

@article{Dannecker2013a,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Accurately and precisely estimating free-living energy expenditure (EE) is important for monitoring energy balance and quantifying physical activity. Recently, single and multisensor devices have been developed that can classify physical activities, potentially resulting in improved estimates of EE.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the validity of EE estimation of a footwear-based physical activity monitor and to compare this validity against a variety of research and consumer physical activity monitors.

METHODS: Nineteen healthy young adults (10 men, 9 women) completed a 4-h stay in a room calorimeter. Participants wore a footwear-based physical activity monitor as well as Actical, ActiGraph, IDEEA, DirectLife, and Fitbit devices. Each individual performed a series of postures/activities. We developed models to estimate EE from the footwear-based device, and we used the manufacturer's software to estimate EE for all other devices.

RESULTS: Estimated EE using the shoe-based device was not significantly different than measured EE (mean ± SE; 476 ± 20 vs 478 ± 18 kcal, respectively) and had a root-mean-square error of 29.6 kcal (6.2{\%}). The IDEEA and the DirectLlife estimates of EE were not significantly different than the measured EE, but the ActiGraph and the Fitbit devices significantly underestimated EE. Root-mean-square errors were 93.5 (19{\%}), 62.1 kcal (14{\%}), 88.2 kcal (18{\%}), 136.6 kcal (27{\%}), 130.1 kcal (26{\%}), and 143.2 kcal (28{\%}) for Actical, DirectLife, IDEEA, ActiGraph, and Fitbit, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The shoe-based physical activity monitor provides a valid estimate of EE, whereas the other physical activity monitors tested have a wide range of validity when estimating EE. Our results also demonstrate that estimating EE based on classification of physical activities can be more accurate and precise than estimating EE based on total physical activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The federal mandate for local wellness policies (LWP) provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve schools' practices that support student health, which, in turn, supports academic achievement. With a full agenda and budget challenges, districts need resources and support to turn policies into sustainable practices. The purpose of this study was to assess district policy goals and compare them to the federal mandate and benchmarks of best practices. It is hoped that this information will lead to development of specific assistance in the areas of policy implementation, evaluation, and revision. METHODS: Action for Healthy Kids (AFHK) collected a convenience sample of 256 approved LWP. The sample included districts with small, medium, and large student enrollment from every state (except Hawaii). Policies were compared to federal requirements and the AFHK Wellness Policy Fundamentals, a tool which documents best practices for nutrition and physical activity in schools. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of policies sampled were consistent with the mandates set forth in the law. Thirty-two percent did not address 1 or more goal areas set by the federal mandate with 15{\%} not addressing goals for evaluation and monitoring. None of the policies addressed all components of AFHK's Fundamentals. Less than 1{\%} addressed all 4 of the evaluation components. Teacher requirements and training for nutrition and physical education were addressed by 43{\%} and 45{\%} of policies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings indicate schools will need assistance to meet each of the mandates provided by the federal mandate. Areas lacking attention in policies, yet essential for sustaining wellness practices, include assurances of qualified staff, opportunities for staff development, and implementation, evaluation, and revision of the policy.},

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: In 2001, children were recruited from 19 primary schools in Melbourne, Australia. Parents completed a questionnaire about their child's TV viewing and the family environment. Children also completed a questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for 8 days. Movement counts were used to identify low-active children (lowest quartile). Data were analyzed in May 2004. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 878 children (mean age = 11.5 +/- 0.6 yrs). Multiple logistic regression revealed that socioeconomic status [adjusted odds ratios (AOR) = 0.4 boys], frequency families watched TV together (AOR = 2.0 boys), mothers' (AOR = 1.8 boys; AOR = 2.5 girls) and fathers' (AOR = 2.6 boys; AOR = 2.8 girls) TV viewing, and rules prohibiting TV during mealtimes (AOR = 0.6 boys; AOR = 0.6 girls) related to children watching TV >or=2 h/d. Variables associated with low-level physical activity included self-reported enjoyment of Internet use (AOR = 1.7 boys) and preference for watching TV (AOR = 2.3 girls), perception that mother uses computer a lot (AOR = 1.9 boys) and likes using the computer (AOR = 0.6 girls), fathers' reported computer/electronic games use (AOR = 1.7 girls), frequency families used computer together (AOR = 0.4 girls), rules that TV viewing must be supervised (AOR = 1.9 boys; AOR = 0.6 girls), and having pay TV (AOR = 0.6 boys) and electronic games at home (AOR = 2.6 boys). DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that the relationships between the family environment and TV viewing and low-level activity are complex and that these behaviors are distinct.},

abstract = {Activity-related energy expenditure (AEE) is difficult to quantify, especially under sedentary conditions. Here, a model was developed using the detected type of physical activity (PA) and movement intensity (MI), based on a tri-axial seismic accelerometer (DynaPort MiniMod; McRoberts B.V., The Hague, the Netherlands), with energy expenditure for PA as a reference. The relation between AEE (J/min/kg), MI, and the type of PA was determined for standardized PAs as performed in a laboratory including: lying, sitting, standing, and walking. AEE (J/min/kg) was calculated from total energy expenditure (TEE) and sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) as assessed with indirect calorimetry ((TEEx0.9)-SMR). Subsequently, the model was validated over 23-h intervals in a respiration chamber. Subjects were 15 healthy women (age: 22+/-2 years; BMI: 24.0+/-4.0 kg/m2). Predicted AEE in the chamber was significantly related to measured AEE both within (r2=0.81+/-0.06, P<0.00001) and between (r2=0.70, P<0.001) subjects. The explained variation in AEE by the model was higher than the explained variation by MI alone. This shows that a tri-axial seismic accelerometer is a valid tool for estimating AEE under sedentary conditions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that the environment plays a role in influencing physical activity in children and adults. As children have less autonomy in their behavioural choices, neighbourhood environment supportiveness may be an important determinant of their ability to be active. Yet we know rather little about the types of environment that children use for bouts of physical activity. This study uses accelerometery and global positioning system technologies to identify the charactieristics of environments being used for bouts of continuous moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in a sample of English schoolchildren. METHODS: The study used a convenience sample of 100 children from SPEEDY (Sport, Physical activity and Eating behaviour: Environmental Determinants in Young people), a cohort of 2064 9-10 year-olds from Norfolk, England, recruited in 2007. Children wore an ActiGraph GT1M accelerometer and a Garmin Forerunner 205 GPS unit over four consecutive days. Accelerometery data points were matched to GPS locations and bouts (5 minutes or more) of MVPA were identified. Bout locations were overlaid with a detailed landcover dataset developed in a GIS to identify the types of environment supporting MVPA. Findings are presented using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Boys were also more active than girls, spending an average of 20 (SD 23) versus 11 (SD 15) minutes per day in MVPA bouts. Children who spent more time outside the home were more active (p = 0.002), especially girls and children living in rural locations (both p < 0.05). Children tended to be active close to home, with 63{\%} of all bout time occurring inside neighbourhoods, although boys (p = 0.05) and rural children (p = 0.01) were more likely to roam outside their neighbourhood. Amongst urban children, gardens (28{\%} of bout time) and the street environment (20{\%}) were the most commonly used environments for MVPA bouts. Amongst rural children farmland (22{\%}) and grassland (18{\%}) were most frequently used. CONCLUSION: The study has developed a new methodology for the identification of environments in which bouts of continuous physical activity are undertaken. The results highlight the importance of the provision of urban gardens and greenspaces, and the maintenance of safe street environments as places for children to be active.},

abstract = {There is convincing evidence that targeting self-efficacy is an effective means of increasing physical activity. However, evidence concerning which are the most effective techniques for changing self-efficacy and thereby physical activity is lacking. The present review aims to estimate the association between specific intervention techniques used in physical activity interventions and change obtained in both self-efficacy and physical activity behaviour. A systematic search yielded 27 physical activity intervention studies for 'healthy' adults that reported self-efficacy and physical activity data. A small, yet significant (P < 0.01) effect of the interventions was found on change in self-efficacy and physical activity (d = 0.16 and 0.21, respectively). When a technique was associated with a change in effect sizes for self-efficacy, it also tended to be associated with a change (r(s) = 0.690, P < 0.001) in effect size for physical activity. Moderator analyses found that 'action planning', 'provide instruction' and 'reinforcing effort towards behaviour' were associated with significantly higher levels of both self-efficacy and physical activity. 'Relapse prevention' and 'setting graded tasks' were associated with significantly lower self-efficacy and physical activity levels. This meta-analysis provides evidence for which psychological techniques are most effective for changing self-efficacy and physical activity.},

METHODS: We used data from the National Latino and Asian American Survey (2002-2003) to generate nationally representative estimates of mean BMI and obesity prevalence and explored changes in the distribution of BMI by generational status. Analyses tested the association between generational status and BMI and examined whether this association varied by ethnicity, education, or gender. RESULTS: We found substantial heterogeneity in BMI and obesity by country of origin and an increase in BMI in later generations among most subgroups. The data suggest different patterns for Latinos and Asian Americans in the nature and degree of distributional changes in BMI with generational status in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Generational status is associated with increased BMI and obesity among Latinos and Asian Americans. Aggregate estimates not accounting for nativity and country of origin may mask significant heterogeneity in the prevalence of obesity and patterns of distributional change, with implications for prevention strategies.},

The authors examined the association among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and ovarian cancer risk in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective study of cancer incidence and mortality, using information obtained at baseline in 1992. From 1992 to 2001, 314 incident ovarian cancer cases were identified among 59,695 postmenopausal women who were cancer free at enrollment. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compute hazard rate ratios while adjusting for potential confounders. No overall association was observed between measures of past physical activity or with recreational physical activity at baseline and risk of ovarian cancer in this study (for the highest category of physical activity compared with none: hazard rate ratio = 0.73, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.40, 1.34). However, a prolonged duration of sedentary behavior was associated with an increased risk (for > or = 6 vs. < 3 hours per day: hazard rate ratio = 1.55, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.08, 2.22; p(trend) = 0.01). Results from this study suggest that high levels of sedentary behavior may increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but they do not support a major impact of light and moderate physical activity on ovarian cancer risk.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:                       Although polysomnography is necessary for diagnosis of most sleep disorders, it is also expensive, time-consuming, intrusive, and interferes with sleep. Field-based activity monitoring is increasingly used as an alternative measure that can be used to answer certain clinical and research questions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of a novel activity monitoring device (Fitbit) compared to both polysomnography and standard actigraphy (Actiwatch-64).                                         METHODS:                       To test validity, simultaneous Fitbit and actigraph were worn during standard overnight polysomnography by 24 healthy adults at the West Virginia University sleep research laboratory. To test inter-Fitbit reliability, three participants also wore two of the Fitbit devices overnight at home.                                         RESULTS:                       Fitbit showed high intradevice reliability =96.5-99.1. Fitbit and actigraph differed significantly on recorded total sleep time and sleep efficiency between each other and polysomnography. Bland-Altman plots indicated that both Fitbit and actigraph overestimated sleep efficiency and total sleep time. Sensitivity of both Fitbit and actigraphy for accurately identifying sleep was high within all sleep stages and during arousals; specificity of both Fitbit and actigraph for accurately identifying wake was poor. Specificity of actigraph was higher except for wake before sleep onset; sensitivity of Fitbit was higher in all sleep stages and during arousals.                                         CONCLUSIONS:                       The web-based Fitbit, available at a markedly reduced price and with several convenience factors compared to standard actigraphy, may be an acceptable activity measurement instrument for use with normative populations. However, Fitbit has the same specificity limitations as actigraphy; both devices consistently misidentify wake as sleep and thus overestimate both sleep time and quality. Use of the Fitbit will also require specific validation before it can be used to assess disordered populations and or different age groups.},

Mean hours per day spent in sedentary behavior ranged from 5.5 to 8.5. The largest disparities were by gender and age. An improved understanding of correlates may inform the design of interventions to increase physical activity in targeted subgroups. Additional theoretically based research is needed to elucidate which factors contributing to physical activity disparities are amenable to change via intervention. To eliminate health disparities, changes in policies that have an impact on physical activity may be necessary to promote physical activity among high-risk youth.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In the present study, the authors extend previous cross-sectional findings by using a prospective design to determine whether physical and social environmental characteristics predict physical activity over 6 months. DESIGN: Inactive adults were recruited to the Activity Counseling Trial, a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of physical activity intervention in primary care. Participants were 387 women and 474 men aged 35-75 years in 3 regions; 1/3 were minorities; 56{\%} had some college education. Baseline perceived environmental variables were used to predict physical activity at 6 months, adjusting for experimental condition and other potential moderators. MEASURES: The validated 7-day physical activity recall interview was used to estimate minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. A standardized survey was used to measure social and physical environmental variables around the home and neighborhood. RESULTS: Women reporting no unattended dogs and low crime in their neighborhoods and men reporting frequently seeing people being active in their neighborhoods did 50-75 more minutes of physical activity per week than did those with different environmental characteristics. Interactions of environmental variables with age group suggested that older adults may be more affected by environmental variables than are younger adults. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported social and physical environmental variables were significantly related to moderate to vigorous physical activity among a diverse sample of adults living in 3 regions of the United States. These prospective findings strengthen the conclusion from previous cross-sectional studies that environmental variables are important correlates of physical activity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a school-based intervention designed to increase physical activity among sedentary adolescent females. METHODS: Sedentary adolescent females were assigned to a control (n = 22) or intervention (n = 25) group based on school attended. Students at the intervention school enrolled in a special physical education class. All participants completed clinical and behavioral assessments at baseline and after 4 months. Physiological tests included cardiovascular fitness (VO(2) peak via bicycle ergometer), body composition (via dual x-ray absorptiometer; DEXA), and body mass index (BMI). Psychosocial assessments included a physical activity recall, report of lifestyle activity, and self-efficacy, perceived barriers, social support, and enjoyment related to physical activity. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for continuous variables, and logistic regression for hard activity (scored as a dichotomous variable). RESULTS: The intervention had a significant effect on cardiovascular fitness (p =.017), lifestyle activity (p =.005), and light (p =.023), moderate (p =.007), and hard (p =.006) activity. All changes were in a direction that favored the intervention. There was no effect of the intervention on psychosocial factors related to exercise. CONCLUSIONS: A school-based intervention targeting sedentary adolescent females can increase physical activity and prevent a decline in cardiovascular fitness. Moreover, the effect of the intervention generalized to lifestyle activity.},

abstract = {How do healthcare providers know if their patients are getting enough physical activity to promote good health and to reduce their risks of chronic diseases and injury? The first step is to identify the patient's current level of physical activity using questionnaires and/or motion sensors. Questionnaires assess activity levels by having patients answer a set of questions about the types and amounts of activity performed at some time in the past. Motion sensors assess physical activity by patients wearing a small monitoring device that records their body movement as it occurs. If a provider is interested in determining a patient's caloric energy expenditure, he/she can apply statistical regression models to the questionnaire and motion sensor data to estimate kilocalories. If more precise measures of energy expenditure are desired, a provider can use the isotopic doubly labelled water method to estimate kilocalories; however, this method is costly and is impractical in non-research clinical settings.},

@article{Ekelund2007,
abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: High levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and physical activity (PA) are associated with a favourable metabolic risk profile. However, there has been no thorough exploration of the independent contributions of cardiorespiratory fitness and subcomponents of activity (total PA, time spent sedentary, and time spent in light, moderate and vigorous intensity PA) to metabolic risk factors in children and the relative importance of these factors. METHODS: We performed a population-based, cross-sectional study in 9- to 10- and 15- to 16-year-old boys and girls from three regions of Europe (n = 1709). We examined the independent associations of subcomponents of PA and CRF with metabolic risk factors (waist circumference, BP, fasting glucose, insulin, triacylglycerol and HDL-cholesterol levels). Clustered metabolic risk was expressed as a continuously distributed score calculated as the average of the standardised values of the six subcomponents. RESULTS: CRF (standardised beta = -0.09, 95{\%} CI -0.12, -0.06), total PA (standardised beta = -0.08, 95{\%} CI -0.10, -0.05) and all other subcomponents of PA were significantly associated with clustered metabolic risk. After excluding waist circumference from the summary score and further adjustment for waist circumference as a confounding factor, the magnitude of the association between CRF and clustered metabolic risk was attenuated (standardised beta = -0.05, 95{\%} CI -0.08, -0.02), whereas the association with total PA was unchanged (standardised beta = -0.08 95{\%} CI -0.10, -0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: PA and CRF are separately and independently associated with individual and clustered metabolic risk factors in children. The association between CRF and clustered risk is partly mediated or confounded by adiposity, whereas the association between activity and clustered risk is independent of adiposity. Our results suggest that fitness and activity affect metabolic risk through different pathways.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The Australian Women's Activity Survey (AWAS) was developed based on a systematic review and qualitative research on how to measure activity patterns of women with young children (WYC). AWAS assesses activity performed across five domains (planned activities, employment, child care, domestic responsibilities, and transport) and intensity levels (sitting, light intensity, brisk walking, moderate intensity, and vigorous intensity) in a typical week in the past month. The purpose of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and criterion validity of the AWAS. METHODS: WYC completed the AWAS on two occasions 7 d apart (test-retest reliability protocol) and/or wore a Manufacturing Technology Inc. (MTI) ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 d in between (validity protocol). Forty WYC (mean age 35 +/- 5 yr) completed the test-retest reliability protocol and 75 WYC (mean age 33 +/- 5 yr) completed the validity protocol. Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between AWAS administrations and Spearman's correlation coefficients (rs) between AWAS and MTI data were calculated. RESULTS: AWAS showed good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.80 (0.65-0.89)) and acceptable criterion validity (rs = 0.28, P = 0.01) for measuring weekly health-enhancing physical activity. AWAS also provided repeatable and valid estimates of sitting time (test-retest reliability, ICC = 0.42 (0.13-0.64); criterion validity, rs = 0.32, (P = 0.006)). CONCLUSION: The measurement properties of the AWAS are comparable to those reported for existing self-report measures of physical activity. However, AWAS offers a more comprehensive and flexible alternative for accurately assessing different domains and intensities of activity relevant to WYC. Future research should investigate whether the AWAS is a suitable measure of intervention efficacy by examining its sensitivity to change.},

@article{Middelweerd2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transition from adolescence to early adulthood is a critical period in which there is a decline in physical activity (PA). College and university students make up a large segment of this age group. Smartphones may be used to promote and support PA. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore Dutch students' preferences regarding a PA application (PA app) for smartphones.

METHODS: Thirty Dutch students (aged 18-25 years) used a PA app for three weeks and subsequently attended a focus group discussion (k = 5). To streamline the discussion, a discussion guide was developed covering seven main topics, including general app usage, usage and appreciation of the PA app, appreciation of and preferences for its features and the sharing of PA accomplishments through social media. The discussions were audio and video recorded, transcribed and analysed according to conventional content analysis.

RESULTS: The participants, aged 21 ± 2 years, were primarily female (67{\%}). Several themes emerged: app usage, technical aspects, PA assessment, coaching aspects and sharing through social media. Participants most often used social networking apps (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), communication apps (e.g., WhatsApp) and content apps (e.g., news reports or weather forecasts). They preferred a simple and structured layout without unnecessary features. Ideally, the PA app should enable users to tailor it to their personal preferences by including the ability to hide features. Participants preferred a companion website for detailed information about their accomplishments and progress, and they liked tracking their workout using GPS. They preferred PA apps that coached and motivated them and provided tailored feedback toward personally set goals. They appreciated PA apps that enabled competition with friends by ranking or earning rewards, but only if the reward system was transparent. They were not willing to share their regular PA accomplishments through social media unless they were exceptionally positive.

CONCLUSIONS: Participants prefer PA apps that coach and motivate them, that provide tailored feedback toward personally set goals and that allow competition with friends.},

Obesity is linked to several serious health problems and medical conditions. Medical experts agree that physical activity is critical to maintaining fitness, reducing weight, and improving health, yet many people have difficulty increasing and maintaining physical activity in everyday life. Clinical studies have shown that health benefits can occur from simply increasing the number of steps one takes each day and that social support can motivate people to stay active. In this paper, we describe Houston, a prototype mobile phone application for encouraging activity by sharing step count with friends. We also present four design requirements for technologies that encourage physical activity that we derived from a three-week long in situ pilot study that was conducted with women who wanted to increase their physical activity.},

abstract = {Background : Accurate measurement of physical activity is essential for understanding the relationship between physical activity (PA) and health outcomes. Technological advances have led to a surge in commercially-available pedometers, however, limited scientific evidence exists regarding their accuracy  Purpose : This study is the first to test the quality of the newly developed Fitbit step-counter and comparability relative to the Yamax SW-200 pedometer.  Methods : Ten healthy young adults participated. The quality of the Fitbit was assessed through: 1) a 20 Step Test; 2) a motor vehicle test; and 3) a treadmill test at various speeds (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 km×h -1 ) on three locations on the body (inside pocket, waist, upper body).  Results : The 20 Step Test revealed that none of the Fitbits had error scores greater than +/- 5{\%} and during the motor vehicle condition, the Fitbits did not record any spurious movement. Statistical differences were found between the observed steps and detected steps for Yamax at walking speeds of 2 km×h -1  (p {\&}lt; 0.001) and 3 km×h -1  (p {\&}lt; 0.05), as well as the waist-mounted Fitbit at 2 km×h -1  (p {\&}lt; 0.05). All locations of the Fitbit and the Yamax were very accurate at normal walking speeds of 4.5 km×h -1  and 6.0 km×h -1 . In terms of running speeds (8 km×h -1 , 9 km×h -1 , 10 km×h -1 , 11 km×h -1 ) there were only significant differences found between observed steps and detected steps for the Fitbit in the pocket.  Conclusions : Our quality-control testing should now enable physical activity practitioners, consumers and researchers alike to make a more informed decision on whether to purchase and utilize the FitBit.},

abstract = {We provide a wide-ranging review of health-related physical activity in children and adolescents using a behavioural epidemiology framework. In contrast to many other reviews, we highlight issues associated with true sedentary behaviours alongside physically active behaviours. Specifically, we review the evidence concerning the links between physical activity and cardiovascular disease, overweight and obesity, psychosocial measures, type II diabetes, and skeletal health. Although the evidence is unconvincing at times, several factors lead to the conclusion that promoting physical activity in youth is desirable. A review of the prevalence of physical activity and sedentary behaviours shows that many young people are active, but this declines with age. A substantial number are not adequately active for health benefits and current trends in juvenile obesity are a cause for concern. Prevalence data on sedentary behaviours are less extensive but suggest that total media use by young people has not changed greatly in recent years. Most children and adolescents do not exceed recommended daily hours of TV viewing. Physical activity is unrelated to TV viewing. We also identified the key determinants of physical activity in this age group, highlighting demographic, biological, psychological, behavioural, social and environmental determinants. Interventions were considered for school, family and community environments. Finally, policy recommendations are offered for the education, governmental, sport and recreation, health, and mass media sectors.},

abstract = {To improve our understanding of indoor and outdoor personal exposures to common environmental toxicants released into the environment, new technologies that can monitor and quantify the toxicants anytime anywhere are needed. This paper presents a wearable sensor to provide such capabilities. The sensor can communicate with a common smart phone and provides accurate measurement of volatile organic compound concentration at a personal level in real time, providing environmental toxicants data every three minutes. The sensor has high specificity and sensitivity to aromatic, alkyl, and chlorinated hydrocarbons with a resolution as low as 4 parts per billion (ppb), with a detection range of 4 ppb to 1000 ppm (parts per million). The sensor's performance was validated using Gas Chromatography and Selected Ion Flow Tube - Mass Spectrometry reference methods in a variety of environments and activities with overall accuracy higher than 81{\%} (r(2) > 0.9). Field tests examined personal exposure in various scenarios including: indoor and outdoor environments, traffic exposure in different cities which vary from 0 to 50 ppmC (part-per-million carbon from hydrocarbons), and pollutants near the 2010 Deepwater Horizon's oil spill. These field tests not only validated the performance but also demonstrated unprecedented high temporal and spatial toxicant information provided by the new technology.},

abstract = {The obesity epidemic is a global trend and is of particular concern in children. Recent reports have highlighted the severity of obesity in children by suggesting: "today's generation of children will be the first for over a century for whom life expectancy falls." This review assesses the evidence that identifies the important role of physical activity in the growth, development and physical health of young people, owing to its numerous physical and psychological health benefits. Key issues, such as "does a sedentary lifestyle automatically lead to obesity" and "are levels of physical activity in today's children less than physical activity levels in children from previous generations?", are also discussed.Today's environment enforces an inactive lifestyle that is likely to contribute to a positive energy balance and childhood obesity. Whether a child or adolescent, the evidence is conclusive that physical activity is conducive to a healthy lifestyle and prevention of disease. Habitual physical activity established during the early years may provide the greatest likelihood of impact on mortality and longevity. It is evident that environmental factors need to change if physical activity strategies are to have a significant impact on increasing habitual physical activity levels in children and adolescents. There is also a need for more evidence-based physical activity guidelines for children of all ages. Efforts should be concentrated on facilitating an active lifestyle for children in an attempt to put a stop to the increasing prevalence of obese children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Before starting interventions addressing energy-balance related behaviors, knowledge is needed about the prevalence of sedentary behaviors and low physical exercise, their interrelationships, possible gender differences. Therefore this study aimed to describe gender differences in sedentary and physical exercise behaviors and their association with overweight status in children from nine European countries. Additionally, to identify clusters of children sharing the same pattern regarding sedentary and physical exercise behavior and compare these groups regarding overweight status. METHODS: Cross-sectional study among 11-year-old children in nine countries (n = 12538). Self-administered questionnaires assessed the time spent on TV viewing during dinner and during the day, PC use and on physical exercise. The parents reported children's weight and height. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and logistic regression analyses were used for data analyses. RESULTS: Boys spent more time on sedentary behaviors but also more on physical exercise than girls. High TV viewing and low exercise behavior independently increased the risk of being overweight. Based on the behaviors, five clusters were identified. Among boys, clear associations with being overweight were found, with the most unhealthy behavior pattern having the highest risks of being overweight. Among girls, high TV viewers and high PC users had increased risk of being overweight. In girls sedentary behaviors seemed more important than physical exercise with regard to overweight status. CONCLUSION: Despite selective non-response on BMI and reliance on self-reports, the associations between clusters and overweight in boys were clear, and differences between boys and girls regarding the behaviors and risks for overweight are noteworthy. These differences need to be considered when developing tailored intervention strategies for prevention of overweight.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and correlates of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior among immigrant and US-born children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health, a telephone survey conducted between January 29, 2003, and July 1, 2004. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: Multivariate logistic and least squares regression models were used to analyze immigrant differentials among 68 288 children aged 6 through 17 years. Main Exposure Ethnic-immigrant status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and odds of regular physical activity, inactivity, television watching, and lack of sports participation. RESULTS: Physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic-immigrant groups. For example, 22.5{\%} of immigrant Hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9.5{\%} of US-born white children with US-born parents. Approximately 67{\%} of immigrant Hispanic children did not participate in sports compared with 30.2{\%} of native Asian children. Overall, immigrant children were significantly more likely to be physically inactive and less likely to participate in sports than native children; they were, however, less likely to watch television 3 or more hours per day than native children, although the nativity gap narrowed with increasing acculturation levels. Compared with native white children, the adjusted odds of physical inactivity and lack of sports participation were both 2 times higher for immigrant Hispanic children with foreign-born parents, and the odds of television watching were 1.5 and 2.3 times higher for native Hispanic and black children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrant children in each ethnic minority group generally had higher physical inactivity and lower sports participation levels than native children. To reduce disparities, health education programs need to promote physical activity among children in immigrant families.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Well-designed public open space (POS) that encourages physical activity is a community asset that could potentially contribute to the health of local residents. METHODS: In 1995-1996, two studies were conducted-an environmental audit of POS over 2 acres (n =516) within a 408-km2 area of metropolitan Perth, Western Australia; and personal interviews with 1803 adults (aged 18 to 59 years) (52.9{\%} response rate). The association between access to POS and physical activity was examined using three accessibility models that progressively adjusted for distance to POS, and its attractiveness and size. In 2002, an observational study examined the influence of attractiveness on the use of POS by observing users of three pairs of high- and low-quality (based on attractiveness) POS matched for size and location. RESULTS: Overall, 28.8{\%} of respondents reported using POS for physical activity. The likelihood of using POS increased with increasing levels of access, but the effect was greater in the model that adjusted for distance, attractiveness, and size. After adjustment, those with very good access to large, attractive POS were 50{\%} more likely to achieve high levels of walking (odds ratio, 1.50; 95{\%} confidence level, 1.06-2.13). The observational study showed that after matching POS for size and location, 70{\%} of POS users observed visited attractive POS. CONCLUSIONS: Access to attractive, large POS is associated with higher levels of walking. To increase walking, thoughtful design (and redesign) of POS is required that creates large, attractive POS with facilities that encourage active use by multiple users (e.g., walkers, sports participants, picnickers).},

abstract = {The authors investigated whether neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics are associated with coronary heart disease prevalence and risk factors, whether these associations persist after adjustment for individual-level social class indicators, and whether the effects of individual-level indicators vary across neighborhoods. The study sample consisted of 12,601 persons in four US communities (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Jackson, Mississippi) participating in the baseline examination of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (1987-1989). Neighborhood characteristics were obtained from 1990 US Census block-group measures. Multilevel models were used to estimate associations with neighborhood variables after adjustment for individual-level indicators of social class. Living in deprived neighborhoods was associated with increased prevalence of coronary heart disease and increased levels of risk factors, with associations generally persisting after adjustment for individual-level variables. Inconsistent associations were documented for serum cholesterol and disease prevalence in African-American men. For Jackson African-American men living in poor neighborhoods, coronary heart disease prevalence decreased as neighborhood characteristics worsened. Additionally, in African-American men from Jackson, low social class was associated with increased serum cholesterol in "richer" neighborhoods but decreased serum cholesterol in "poorer" neighborhoods. Neighborhood environments may be one of the pathways through which social structure shapes coronary heart disease risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the epidemic of childhood obesity, there is national interest in state-level school policies related to nutrition and physical activity, policies adopted by states, and relationships to youth obesity. PURPOSE: This study develops a comprehensive state-level approach to characterize the overall obesity prevention policy environment for schools and links the policy environments to youth obesity for each state. METHODS: Using 2006 School Health Policies and Programs Study (SHPPS) state data, qualitative and quantitative methods were used (2008-2009) to construct domains of state-level school obesity prevention policies and practices, establish the validity and reliability of the domain scales, and examine their associations with state-level obesity prevalence among youth aged 10-17 years from the 2003 National Survey of Children's Health. RESULTS: Nearly 250 state-level obesity prevention-policy questions were identified from the SHPPS. Three broad policy topic areas containing 100 food service and nutrition (FSN) questionnaire items; 146 physical activity and education (PAE) items; and two weight assessment (WA) items were selected. Principal components analysis and content validity assessment were used to further categorize the items into six FSN, ten PAE, and one WA domain. Using a proportional scaled score to summarize the number of policies adopted by states, it was found that on average states adopted about half of the FSN (49{\%}), 38{\%} of the PAE, and 17{\%} of the WA policies examined. After adjusting for state-level measures of ethnicity and income, the average proportion of FSN policies adopted by states was correlated with the prevalence of youth obesity at r =0.35 (p=0.01). However, no correlation was found between either PAE or WA policies and youth obesity (PAE policies at r =0.02 [p=0.53] and WA policies at r =0.16 [p=0.40]). CONCLUSIONS: States appear to be doing a better job adopting FSN policies than PA or WA policies, and adoption of policies is correlated with youth obesity. Continued monitoring of these policies seems to be warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions have been found to reduce healthcare utilisation in people with long-term conditions, but further work is needed to identify which components of these interventions are most effective. Self-monitoring is one such component and is associated with significant clinical benefits. The aim of this systematic review of reviews is to assess the impact of self-monitoring interventions on healthcare utilisation across a range of chronic illnesses.

METHODS: An overview of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Multiple databases were searched (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, AMED, EBM and HMIC) along with the reference lists of included reviews. A narrative synthesis was performed, accompanied by calculation of the Corrected Cover Area to understand the impact of overlapping primary research papers.

RESULTS: A total of 17 systematic reviews and meta-analyses across three chronic conditions, heart failure, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were included. Self-monitoring was associated with significant reductions in hospitalisation and re-admissions to hospital.

CONCLUSIONS: Self-monitoring has the potential to reduce the pressure placed on secondary care services, but this may lead to increase in services elsewhere in the system. Further work is needed to determine how these findings affect healthcare costs.},

abstract = {Epidemiologic research focuses on estimating exposure-disease associations. In some applications the exposure may be dichotomized, for instance when threshold levels of the exposure are of primary public health interest (e.g., consuming 5 or more fruits and vegetables per day may reduce cancer risk). Errors in exposure variables are known to yield biased regression coefficients in exposure-disease models. Methods for bias-correction with continuous mismeasured exposures have been extensively discussed, and are often based on validation substudies, where the "true" and imprecise exposures are observed on a small subsample. In this paper, we focus on biases associated with dichotomization of a mismeasured continuous exposure. The amount of bias, in relation to measurement error in the imprecise continuous predictor, and choice of dichotomization cut point are discussed. Measurement error correction via regression calibration is developed for this scenario, and compared to na{\"{\i}}vely using the dichotomized mismeasured predictor in linear exposure-disease models. Properties of the measurement error correction method (i.e., bias, mean-squared error) are assessed via simulations.},

abstract = {Purpose To describe physical activity (PA) intensity across a school day and assess the percentage of girls and boys achieving recommended guidelines. Methods The authors measured PA via accelerometry in 380 children (8-11 years) and examined data representing (1) the whole school day, (2) regular class time, (3) recess, (4) lunch and (5) scheduled physical education (PE). Activity was categorised as sedentary (SED), light physical activity (LPA) or moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using age-specific thresholds. They examined sex differences across PA intensities during each time period and compliance with recommended guidelines. Results Girls accumulated less MVPA and more SED than boys throughout the school day (MVPA -10.6 min; SED +13.9 min) recess (MVPA -1.6 min; SED +1.7 min) and lunch (MVPA -3.1 min; SED +2.9 min). Girls accumulated less MVPA (-6.2 min), less LPA (-2.5 min) and more SED (+9.4 min) than boys during regular class time. Fewer girls than boys achieved PA guidelines during school (90.9{\%} vs 96.2{\%}), recess (15.7{\%} vs 34.1{\%}) and lunch (16.7{\%} vs 37.4{\%}). During PE, only 1.8{\%} of girls and 2.9{\%} of boys achieved the PA guidelines. Girls and boys accumulated similar amounts of MVPA, LPA and SED. Conclusion The MVPA deficit in girls was due to their sedentary behaviour as opposed to LPA. Physical activity strategies that target girls are essential to overcome this deficit. Only a very small percentage of children met physical activity guidelines during PE. There is a great need for additional training and emphasis on PA during PE. In addition schools should complement PE with PA models that increase PA opportunities across the school day.},

abstract = {From infancy through adolescence, more and more children are becoming overweight. National prevalence data show that more than 17{\%} of youth have a body mass index (BMI) above the 95th percentile of the US age and sex-specific reference. Particularly alarming are rates in children as young as 2 years of age, and among minority children. Periods of heightened vulnerability to weight gain have been identified, and research supports the notion that obesity has its origins in early life. This paper focuses on susceptibility to increased adiposity during the prenatal period, infancy, mid-childhood and adolescence, and how factors operating in each of these periods influence risk of becoming overweight. Prenatal exposure to over or undernutrition, rapid growth in early infancy, an early adiposity rebound in childhood, and early pubertal development have all been implicated in the development of obesity. The persistence of obesity from young ages emphasizes the importance of understanding growth trajectories, and of developing prevention strategies to overcome strong influences of obesigenic environments at young ages.},

abstract = {Changes in policies and built environments are advocated as part of efforts to increase physical activity, but in 2001 the knowledge base to inform these changes was limited. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation addressed this deficit by initiating Active Living Research (ALR). The mission of ALR was to stimulate and support research that could guide the improvement of environments, policies, and practices to promote active living. The program's goals were to (1) build the evidence base about environmental and policy factors related to physical activity, (2) build the capacity of researchers in multiple fields to collaborate, and (3) inform and facilitate policy change. To build the evidence base, 121 grants were supported with {\$}12.5 million. Efforts were made to support new investigators, fund investigators from numerous disciplines, and increase the demographic diversity of researchers. Activities to build capacity to conduct collaborative research included annual conferences, journal supplements, seminars for multiple disciplines, and the posting of environmental measures. Coordination with Active Living Leadership was a primary means of communicating research to policymakers. Other activities to facilitate the application of research included research summaries written for nonresearchers, collaborations with Active Living by Design, several components of the website (www.activelivingresearch.org), and using policy relevance as a funding criterion. Two independent evaluations were accomplished, and they concluded that ALR made progress on all three goals. ALR has been renewed through 2012. The new mission is to use a {\$}15.4 million research budget to contribute to reversing the childhood obesity epidemic, especially among youth in the highest-risk groups.},

The authors describe how formative research results from the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG) were transferred to planners to guide intervention development. Methods included providing oral and written reports, prioritizing recommendations, and cross-checking recommendations with intervention objectives and implementation strategies. Formative work influenced the intervention in many ways. For example, results indicated that middle schools offered only coeducational physical education and health education classes, so the TAAG intervention was designed to be appropriate for both sexes, and intervention strategies were developed to directly address girls' stated preferences (e.g., enjoyable activities, opportunity to socialize) and barriers (e.g., lack of skills, fear of injury) for physical activity. The challenges of using formative research for intervention development are discussed.},

abstract = {This review of the epidemiological evidence regarding physical activity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) provides substantial evidence from many different populations that leisure time physical activity is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular mortality in both men and women and in middle-aged and older individuals. Physical activity appears to be a critical factor in both primary and secondary prevention of CHD. The studies indicate a dose-response relationship between overall physical activity and CVD, which is linear at least up to a certain level of activity. Prospective studies suggest that physical activity is also associated with reduced risk of stroke. The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of physical activity on CVD are still unclear. In recent years. the view that physical activity has to be vigorous to achieve a reduction in risk of CHD has been questioned. Overall, the evidence points to the benefit of continued regular moderate physical activity which does not need to be strenuous or prolonged and includes daily leisure activities such as walking or gardening which are readily attainable by large sections of the population. Taking up regular light or moderate physical activity in middle or older age confers significant benefit for CVD and all-cause mortality.},

abstract = {Research suggests that sedentary behavior may increase the risk of some chronic diseases. The aims of the study were to examine whether sedentary work is associated with colorectal cancer and to determine whether the association differs by subsite. A total of 918 cases and 1,021 controls participated in a population-based case-control study of colorectal cancer in Western Australia in 2005-2007. Data were collected on lifestyle, physical activity, and lifetime job history. The estimated effects of sedentary work on the risk of cancers of the proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum were analyzed by using multinomial logistic regression. Compared with participants who did not spend any time in sedentary work, participants who spent 10 or more years in sedentary work had almost twice the risk of distal colon cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1.94, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.28, 2.93) and a 44{\%} increased risk of rectal cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1.44, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.96, 2.18). This association was independent of recreational physical activity and was seen even among the most recreationally active participants. Sedentary work was not associated with the risk of proximal colon cancer. These results suggest that long-term sedentary work may increase the risk of distal colon cancer and rectal cancer.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: To examine the convergent validity of the ActiGraph and activPAL accelerometers with the Bouchard Activity Record (BAR) in adults. Sedentary behavior and walking were evaluated in all instruments; standing and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was evaluated in only those that detected such variables. METHODS:: Thirty-two participants wore the accelerometers and completed the BAR concurrently for 1 day. Descriptive statistics and delta values were reported for all instruments. Summary time spent in sedentary behavior and walking was compared between all instruments using RMANOVA. Dependent t-tests were used to analyze summary time in 1) standing between activPAL and BAR and 2) MVPA between ActiGraph and BAR. Bland Altman plots were interpreted for systematic bias. On a detailed level, concurrent time interval data were compared using mean percent agreement and kappa statistics. RESULTS:: There was a significant difference found in summary time spent in sedentary behavior apparent between ActiGraph and activPAL as well as between ActiGraph and BAR. There was also a significant difference detected in time spent in walking, apparent between ActiGraph and activPAL and between ActiGraph and BAR. In the time interval analysis, mean percent agreement ranged from 54.0{\%} (for walking detected by ActiGraph and activPAL) to 86.7{\%} (for MVPA by ActiGraph and BAR). Kappa values ranged from 0.25 (for walking by ActiGraph and activPAL) to 0.70 (for sedentary behavior between activPAL and BAR). Differences were also found in standing and MVPA. CONCLUSIONS:: The activPAL and BAR showed convergence on both summary and concurrent time interval levels in both sedentary behavior and walking. The comparative discordance between activPAL and BAR with ActiGraph was likely a function of different approaches used to distinguish sedentary behavior from walking.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet has potential as a medium for health behavior change programs, but no controlled studies have yet evaluated the impact of a fully automated physical activity intervention over several months with real-time objective feedback from a monitor. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the impact of a physical activity program based on the Internet and mobile phone technology provided to individuals for 9 weeks. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, stratified controlled trial was conducted from September to December 2005 in Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, with 77 healthy adults whose mean age was 40.4 years (SD = 7.6) and mean body mass index was 26.3 (SD = 3.4). Participants were randomized to a test group that had access to an Internet and mobile phone-based physical activity program (n = 47) or to a control group (n = 30) that received no support. The test group received tailored solutions for perceived barriers, a schedule to plan weekly exercise sessions with mobile phone and email reminders, a message board to share their experiences with others, and feedback on their level of physical activity. Both groups were issued a wrist-worn accelerometer to monitor their level of physical activity; only the test group received real-time feedback via the Internet. The main outcome measures were accelerometer data and self-report of physical activity. RESULTS: At the end of the study period, the test group reported a significantly greater increase over baseline than did the control group for perceived control (P < .001) and intention/expectation to exercise (P < .001). Intent-to-treat analyses of both the accelerometer data (P = .02) and leisure time self-report data (P = .03) found a higher level of moderate physical activity in the test group. The average increase (over the control group) in accelerometer-measured moderate physical activity was 2 h 18 min per week. The test group also lost more percent body fat than the control group (test group: -2.18, SD = 0.59; control group: -0.17, SD = 0.81; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: A fully automated Internet and mobile phone-based motivation and action support system can significantly increase and maintain the level of physical activity in healthy adults.},

abstract = {The recent proliferation of wearable self-tracking devices intended to regulate and measure the body has brought contingent questions of controlling, accessing and interpreting personal data. Given a socio-technical context in which individuals are no longer the most authoritative source on data about themselves, wearable self-tracking technologies reflect the simultaneous commodification and knowledge-making that occurs between data and bodies. In this article, we look specifically at wearable, self-tracking devices in order to set up an analytical comparison with a key historical predecessor, the weight scale. By taking two distinct cases of self-tracking - wearables and the weight scale - we can situate current discourses of big data within a historical framing of self-measurement and human subjectivity. While the advertising promises of both the weight scale and the wearable device emphasize self-knowledge and control through external measurement, the use of wearable data by multiple agents and institutions results in a lack of control over data by the user. In the production of self-knowledge, the wearable device is also making the user known to others, in a range of ways that can be both skewed and inaccurate. We look at the tensions surrounding these devices for questions of agency, practices of the body, and the use of wearable data by courtrooms and data science to enforce particular kinds of social and individual discipline.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is a critical signaling molecule of disuse-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. However, few studies have carefully investigated whether similar pathways are modulated with physical activity and age. METHODS: The present study examined lean mass, maximal force production, and skeletal muscle NF-kappaB signaling in 41 men categorized as sedentary (OS, N = 13, 63.85 +/- 6.59 year), physically active (OA, N = 14, 60.71 +/- 5.54 year), or young and sedentary (YS, N = 14, 21.35 +/- 3.84 year). Muscle tissue from the vastus lateralis was assayed for messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the beta subunit of IkB kinase (IKKbeta), cytosolic protein content of phosphorylated inhibitor of kappa B alpha (pIKBalpha), and nuclear content of NF-kappaB subunits p50 and p65. RESULTS: When compared with YS, OS demonstrated age-related muscle atrophy and reduced isokinetic knee extension torque. Physical activity in older individuals preserved maximal isokinetic knee extension torque. OS muscle contained 50{\%} more pIKBalpha than OA and 61{\%} more pIKBalpha than YS. Furthermore, nuclear p65 was significantly elevated in OS compared with YS. OS muscle did not differ from either of the other two groups for nuclear p50 or for mRNA expression of IKKbeta. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that skeletal muscle content of nuclear-bound p65 is elevated by age in humans. The elevation in nuclear-bound p65 appears to be at least partially due to significant increases in pIKBalpha. A sedentary lifestyle appears to play some role in increased IKBalpha; however, further research is needed to identify downstream effects of this increase.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess if a school based intervention was effective in reducing risk factors for obesity. DESIGN: Group randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 10 primary schools in Leeds. PARTICIPANTS: 634 children aged 7-11 years. INTERVENTION: Teacher training, modification of school meals, and the development of school action plans targeting the curriculum, physical education, tuck shops, and playground activities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index, diet, physical activity, and psychological state. RESULTS: Vegetable consumption by 24 hour recall was higher in children in the intervention group than the control group (weighted mean difference 0.3 portions/day, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.2 to 0.4), representing a difference equivalent to 50{\%} of baseline consumption. Fruit consumption was lower in obese children in the intervention group (-1.0, -1.8 to -0.2) than those in the control group. The three day diary showed higher consumption of high sugar foods (0.8, 0.1 to 1.6)) among overweight children in the intervention group than the control group. Sedentary behaviour was higher in overweight children in the intervention group (0.3, 0.0 to 0.7). Global self worth was higher in obese children in the intervention group (0.3, 0.3 to 0.6). There was no difference in body mass index, other psychological measures, or dieting behaviour between the groups. Focus groups indicated higher levels of self reported behaviour change, understanding, and knowledge among children who had received the intervention. CONCLUSION: Although it was successful in producing changes at school level, the programme had little effect on children's behaviour other than a modest increase in consumption of vegetables.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the prevalence, co-occurrence, and correlates of lifestyle related behaviors of overweight women is needed to inform the design of health promotion interventions for weight loss. METHODS: Cross-sectional study involves 394 overweight and obese women, aged 18 to 55 (mean age=41.26), 39{\%} from minority backgrounds, recruited through primary care clinics for a weight loss trial. Dependent variables were the proportion meeting recommended levels of physical activity (measured with an Actigraph), percent calories from fat, and servings of fruits and vegetables (assessed with a Food Frequency Questionnaire, FFQ) and accumulating less than 8 h/day of sedentary time for sedentary behavior (Actigraph). Covariates included socio-demographics, psychosocial variables, diet behaviors, and depression. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of the sample did not engage in at least 30 min/day of physical activity, and 56{\%} spent less than 8 h/day in sedentary activities. About 76{\%} and 79{\%} of the sample did not meet the dietary fat, and fruits and vegetable consumption guidelines, respectively. Two-thirds of the sample had three or more risk factors. Being employed full-time, lower education level, less use of physical activity change strategies, and low levels of social support were associated with higher likelihood of having a greater total number of health risk behaviors. CONCLUSION: Nearly 80{\%} of the sample had multiple lifestyle risk behaviors. Poor dietary behaviors were present in all of the most prevalent risk behavior combinations. Lower socioeconomic and educational status and family and employment obligations characterize overweight and obese women with unhealthy activity and dietary behaviors in need of health promotion interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The possible benefit of lifetime physical activity (PA) in reducing prostate cancer incidence and mortality is unclear. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 45,887 men aged 45-79 years was followed up from January 1998 to December 2007 for prostate cancer incidence (n=2735) and to December 2006 for its subtypes and for fatal (n=190) prostate cancer. RESULTS: We observed an inverse association between lifetime (average of age 30 and 50 years, and baseline age) total PA levels and prostate cancer risk. Multivariate-adjusted incidence in the top quartile of lifetime total PA decreased by 16{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=2-27{\%}) compared with that in the bottom quartile. We also observed an inverse association between average lifetime work or occupational activity and walking or bicycling duration and prostate cancer risk. Compared with men who mostly sit during their main work or occupation, men who sit half of the time experienced a 20{\%} lower risk (95{\%} CI=7-31{\%}). The rate ratio linearly decreased by 7{\%} (95{\%} CI=1-12{\%}) for total, 8{\%} (95{\%} CI=0-16{\%}) for localised and 12{\%} (95{\%} CI=2-20{\%}) for advanced prostate cancer for every 30 min per day increment of lifetime walking or bicycling in the range of 30 to 120 min per day. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that not sitting for most of the time during work or occupational activity and walking or bicycling more than 30 min per day during adult life is associated with reduced incidence of prostate cancer.},

PURPOSE: This pilot study used Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine the time-lagged and concurrent effects of empirically supported social, cognitive, affective, and physiological factors on physical activity among adults age 50+ years. METHODS: Participants (N = 23) responded to diary prompts on a handheld computer four times per day across a 2-week period. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), self-efficacy, positive and negative affect, control, demand, fatigue, energy, social interactions, and stressful events were assessed during each sequence. RESULTS: Multivariate results showed that greater self-efficacy and control predicted greater MVPA at each subsequent assessment throughout the day (p < 0.05). Also, having a positive social interaction was concurrently related to higher levels of MVPA (p = 0.052). CONCLUSION: Time-varying multidimensional individual processes predict within daily physical activity levels.},

abstract = {Children's intakes of fruit, juice, and vegetables (FJV) do not meet the recommended minimum of five daily servings, placing them at increased risk for development of cancer and other diseases. Because children's food preferences and practices are initiated early in life (e.g., 2-5 years of age), early dietary intervention programs may have immediate nutritional benefit, as well as reduce chronic disease risk when learned healthful habits and preferences are carried into adulthood. Families and child-care settings are important social environments within which food-related behaviors among young children are developed. FJV preferences, the primary predictor of FJV consumption in children, are influenced by availability, variety, and repeated exposure. Caregivers (parents and child-care providers) can influence children's eating practices by controlling availability and accessibility of foods, meal structure, food modeling, food socialization practices, and food-related parenting style. Much remains to be learned about how these influences and practices affect the development of FJV preferences and consumption early in life.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the empirical evidence concerning the strength of tracking of sedentary behaviors from childhood and adolescence. METHODS: Published English language studies were located from computerised and manual searches in 2009. Included studies were prospective, longitudinal studies with at least one sedentary behavior for at least two time-points, with tracking coefficients reported, and included children (aged 3-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years) at baseline. RESULTS: Based on data from 21 independent samples, tracking coefficients (r) ranged from 0.08 (over 16 years) to 0.73 (over 2 years) for TV viewing, from 0.18 (boys over 3 years) to 0.52 (over 2 years) for electronic game/computer use, from 0.16 (girls over 4 years) to 0.65 (boys over 2 years) for total screen time, and from -0.15 (boys over 2 years) to 0.48 (over 1 year) for total sedentary time. Study follow-up periods ranged from 1 to upto 27 years, and tracking coefficients tended to be higher with shorter follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behaviors track at moderate levels from childhood or adolescence. Data suggest that sedentary behaviors may form the foundation for such behaviors in the future and some may track slightly better than physical activity.},

abstract = {Unreliable measures limit the ability to detect relationships with other variables. Day-to-day variability in measurement is a source of unreliability. Studies vary substantially in numbers of days needed to reliably assess physical activity. The required numbers of days has probably been underestimated due to violations of the assumption of compound symmetry in using the intraclass correlation. Collecting many days of data become unfeasible in real-world situations. The current dilemma could be solved by adopting distribution correction techniques from nutrition or gaining more information on the measurement model with generalizability studies. This would partition the variance into sources of error that could be minimized. More precise estimates of numbers of days to reliably assess physical activity will likely vary by purpose of the study, type of instrument, and characteristics of the sample. This work remains to be done.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examined factors related to two sources of physical activity for youth: active use of recreation sites and active transport to recreation sites. METHODS: Parents of children (n = 87) and matched pairs of parents and adolescents (n = 124 pairs) in three US cities reported on youths' active use of, proximity to, and walking/biking to 12 recreation sites and on neighborhood walkability and safety. Multivariate regression models evaluated factors associated with youths' frequent site use and active transport to sites. RESULTS: Proximity to the site was associated with frequent use of large parks and public open space. Walking/biking to the site was associated with frequent use of most sites (indoor recreation sites, small and large parks, basketball courts, walking/running tracks, school recreation sites, playgrounds, and public open space). After controlling for proximity and demographic factors, active transport to sites remained significantly associated (P < 0.05) with frequent use of four sites for children (indoor recreation, walking/running tracks, school recreation facilities, and public open space) and all but three sites for adolescents (indoor recreation, playfields/courts, and beach/lake/rivers). Adolescents' active transport to more sites was most positively related to higher perceived traffic safety and to better pedestrian infrastructure and was negatively related to crime threat. Adolescents with driver's licenses walked/biked to recreation sites less often. CONCLUSIONS: Active transport was strongly associated with the use of multiple recreation sites by children and adolescents, even when accounting for proximity and demographic factors. Adolescents living in neighborhoods with better traffic safety walked/biked to more recreation sites for physical activity. Findings support the need for built environments and transportation policies that facilitate safe, active transport to recreation sites for youth physical activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention model of nutrition and lifestyle education on behavior modification, anthropometry and metabolic risk profile of urban Asian-Indian adolescents in North India. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Two schools matched for student strength and middle socioeconomic strata were randomly allocated to intervention and control group. Changes in nutrition-related knowledge, attitude, lifestyle practices, food frequency and body image of eleventh-grade students (15-17 years) in both schools were tested using a validated questionnaire. Anthropometric and biochemical measurements were made using standard methods. Segmental body composition analysis was carried out using an 8-electrode multifrequency bioelectrical impedance method of body fat estimation. RESULTS: At 6 months follow-up, significant improvement in several domains of knowledge was observed in intervention children (n=99; males=60; females=39) as compared with control school children (n=102; males=61; females=41). In the intervention group, significantly lower proportion of children consumed aerated drinks (15.1{\%}; P<0.001) and energy-dense unhealthy foods (8.9{\%}; P=0.03), whereas significantly higher proportion brought tiffin (packed lunch) to school (14.9{\%}; P=0.004) and brought a fruit in their tiffin (30.7{\%}; P<0.001) as compared with the control group. Significant decrease in mean waist circumference (P=0.02, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=-2.43,-0.17), sagittal abdominal diameter (P<0.001, 95{\%} CI=-0.82,-0.09), waist-to-hip ratio (P=0.02, 95{\%} CI=-0.03,-0.004) and fasting blood glucose (P=0.05, 95{\%} CI=-0.09, 5.00) was seen in intervention as compared with control school children. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-component model of nutrition and lifestyle education was successful in improving the nutrition-related knowledge, eating habits and lifestyle practices, and resulted in beneficial changes in anthropometric and biochemical profiles of the Asian Indian adolescents. This model should be applied on countrywide basis to prevent obesity and diabetes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A technical expert panel convened by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institute of Mental Health was charged with reviewing the state of research on behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) in mental health and identifying the top research priorities. BITs refers to behavioral and psychological interventions that use information and communication technology features to address behavioral and mental health outcomes.

METHOD: This study on the findings of the technical expert panel.

RESULTS: Videoconferencing and standard telephone technologies to deliver psychotherapy have been well validated. Web-based interventions have shown efficacy across a broad range of mental health outcomes. Social media such as online support groups have produced disappointing outcomes when used alone. Mobile technologies have received limited attention for mental health outcomes. Virtual reality has shown good efficacy for anxiety and pediatric disorders. Serious gaming has received little work in mental health.

CONCLUSION: Research focused on understanding reach, adherence, barriers and cost is recommended. Improvements in the collection, storage, analysis and visualization of big data will be required. New theoretical models and evaluation strategies will be required. Finally, for BITs to have a public health impact, research on implementation and application to prevention is required.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social support can influence physical activity among some individuals. This study examined the effect that social support has on adolescents' physical activity and their perceived barriers and benefits to exercising. METHODS: A survey was completed by adolescents (N = 535) at 2 single-sex (1 male, 1 female) high schools in Ohio. RESULTS: Adolescents who received parental encouragement to exercise and who had an exercising friend engaged in significantly more days of physical activity in the past week than did their counterparts. Perceived benefits of physical activity differed significantly based on whether the respondent received parental encouragement and had a friend who exercised. Social support for physical activity significantly affected adolescents' perceptions of and engagement in physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Parents should encourage their children to become physically active and partner with peers when exercising.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity tracking studies can determine when children settle into activity patterns and their risk for maintaining sedentary behaviors. This study examined the tracking of activity and sedentary behavior in relation to adiposity during middle childhood. METHODS: Activity intensities and patterns were examined during a 3-year interval in a population-based study of children using accelerometry and survey methods. Data were collected and analyzed from 1998 to 2004. Participants (n = 379) were, on average, 5.6 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 0.5) years at baseline and 8.6 (SD +/- 0.5) years at follow-up. Adiposity was measured with whole-body, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Correlation coefficients and odds ratios were used to assess tracking. The association of activity with adiposity was tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: Over the 3-year interval, Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients between baseline and follow-up activity measures were low to moderate (r = 0.18 to 0.39). Sedentary behavior was more predictable than overall activity, and tended to be more stable (r = 0.37 to 0.52), with the exception of video playing in boys (r = 0.18). Children maintaining a high degree of vigorous activity and low levels of TV viewing were less likely than peers to be in the upper quartile for adiposity at follow-up, and were less likely to gain adiposity during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behavior, including TV viewing, is moderately stable during middle childhood. Health promotion programs that specifically target maintaining high levels of vigorous activity and low levels of TV viewing may help reduce the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity.},

In this article we report a software browser constructed with the aim of using the characteristics of memory to organise SenseCam images into a form that makes the wealth of information stored on SenseCam more accessible. To enable a large amount of visual information to be easily and quickly assimilated by a user, we apply a series of automatic content analysis techniques to structure the images into "events", suggest their relative importance, and select representative images for each. This minimises effort when browsing and searching. We provide anecdotes on use of such a system and emphasise the need for SenseCam images to be meaningfully sorted using such a browser.},

@article{Dennison2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest from academics and clinicians in harnessing smartphone applications (apps) as a means of delivering behavioral interventions for health. Despite the growing availability of a range of health-related apps on the market, academic research on the development and evaluation of such apps is in the relatively early stages. A few existing studies have explored the views of various populations on using mobile phones for health-related issues and some studies are beginning to report user feedback on specific apps. However, there remains little in depth research on users' (and potential users') experiences and views on a wide range of features and technologies that apps are, or will soon be, capable of. In particular, research on young adults is lacking, which is an unfortunate omission considering that this group comprises of a good number of mobile technology adoptors.

OBJECTIVE: The current study sought to explore young adults' perspectives on apps related to health behavior change. It sought their experiences and views of features that might support health behavior change and issues that contribute to interest in and willingness to use such apps.

METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with 19 students and staff at a University in the United Kingdom. Participants included 13 females and 6 males with a mean age of 23.79 (SD 7.89). The focus group discussions centred on participants' experiences of using smartphone apps to support a healthy lifestyle, and their interest in and feelings about features and capabilities of such apps. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.

RESULTS: Study findings suggested that young, currently healthy adults have some interest in apps that attempt to support health-related behavior change. Accuracy and legitimacy, security, effort required, and immediate effects on mood emerged as important influences on app usage. The ability to record and track behavior and goals and the ability to acquire advice and information "on the go" were valued. Context-sensing capabilities and social media features tended to be considered unnecessary and off-putting.

CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insight into the opportunities and challenges involved in delivering health-related behavioral interventions through smartphone apps. The findings suggested a number of valued features and characteristics that app developers may wish to consider when creating health behavior apps. Findings also highlighted several major challenges that appeared to need further consideration and research to ensure the development of effective and well-accepted behavior change apps.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Promotion of physical activity (PA) is at the top of the public health agenda. However, there are few longitudinal studies investigating the relationship between PA and children's mental health. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between self-reported physical activity (PA) and emotional problems 1-year later in a cohort of schoolchildren. METHODS: A total of 1,446 children aged 11-14 years from 39 schools in the North West of England completed a self-report questionnaire in class. Each child reported the total number of sessions of sporting activities (lasting more than 20 min) in which they participated during the previous week, including activities both in school and out of school. This total was averaged for the week in order to determine whether the child was physically active at recommended levels (1 h per day). Childhood emotional problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (self-report) at baseline and 1-year later. Data on potential confounders were also collected by self-report questionnaire at baseline. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, children who, on average, participated in at least 1 h of sporting activity on a daily basis had fewer emotional problems at 1-year follow-up. This attenuated substantially after adjustment for gender (girls were less active but more likely to report emotional problems than boys). After adjustment for additional confounders including emotional problems at baseline, children who met recommended levels for PA had, on average, a score on the emotional problems sub-scale that was 0.29 units lower (-0.29 (95{\%}CI: -0.61, 0.022)) at 1 year follow-up compared to children who did not undertake recommended levels of PA. Children who were physical activity also had higher scores on the hyperactivity sub-scale of the SDQ 1 year later, but there was no evidence to support an association between PA and other behavioural problems. CONCLUSIONS: Children who met recommended levels for PA had fewer emotional problems 1-year later, although the magnitude of this difference was reduced after adjustment for confounders, particularly gender. Future longitudinal studies need to record both PA and emotional problems at more frequent intervals in order to enable us to determine the effect of maintaining a physically active lifestyle on adolescent mental health outcomes.},

Physical activity was assessed at two month intervals using self-report and objective (Actical accelerometers) measures. Self-report results (n = 547) indicated a decline in physical activity throughout the school year for all grades and genders. The decline was attributed largely to a decrease in organized activity participation. Objective physical activity results (n = 40) revealed a significant decline in activity in the latter half of the school year (February to June). Declining physical activity was attributed to a decrease in vigorous activity which was consistent across grade and gender. Collectively, the results highlight the importance of promoting consistent opportunities for adolescents to be active throughout the school year.},

abstract = {Shifting workforce proportions to sedentary occupations and technology developments in traditionally physically demanding occupations have resulted in low physical workloads for many workers. Insufficient physical stress is known to have detrimental short- and long-term effects on health and physical capacity. It is argued herein that many modern workers are at risk of insufficient physical workload. Further, it is argued that the traditional physical ergonomics paradigm of reducing risk by reducing physical loads ('less is better') is not appropriate for many modern occupations. It is proposed that a new paradigm is required, where 'more can be better'. The potential for work to be seen as an arena for improving physical health and capability is discussed and the types of changes to work that may be required are outlined. The paper also discusses challenges and responsibilities presented by this new paradigm for ergonomists, employers, health and safety authorities and the community. The majority of workers in affluent communities now face the significant threat to health of insufficient physical workload. Ergonomics can design work to a prescription that can not only reduce injury risk but enhance health and capacity. However, this will require a change in paradigm.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parents are often involved in interventions to engage youth in physical activity, but it is not clear which methods for involving parents are effective. PURPOSE: A systematic review was conducted of interventions with physical activity and parental components among healthy youth to identify how best to involve parents in physical activity interventions for children. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Identified intervention studies were reviewed in 2008 for study design, description of family components, and physical activity outcomes. The quality of reporting was assessed using the CONSORT checklist for reporting on trials of nonpharmacologic treatments. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The literature search identified 1227 articles, 35 of which met review criteria. Five of the 14 RCTs met > or =70{\%} of CONSORT checklist items. Five general procedures for involving parents were identified: (1) face-to-face educational programs or parent training, (2) family participatory exercise programs, (3) telephone communication, (4) organized activities, and (5) educational materials sent home. Lack of uniformity in reporting trials, multiple pilot studies, and varied measurements of physical activity outcomes prohibited systematic conclusions. Interventions with educational or training programs during family visits or via telephone communication with parents appear to offer some promise. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence for effectiveness of family involvement methods in programs for promoting physical activity in children, because of the heterogeneity of study design, study quality, and outcome measures used. There is a need to build an evidence base of more-predictive models of child physical activity that include parent and child mediating variables and procedures that can effect changes in these variables for future family-based physical activity interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many consumer-based monitors are marketed to provide personal information on the levels of physical activity and daily energy expenditure (EE), but little or no information is available to substantiate their validity.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the validity of EE estimates from a variety of consumer-based, physical activity monitors under free-living conditions.

METHODS: Sixty (26.4 ± 5.7 yr) healthy males (n = 30) and females (n = 30) wore eight different types of activity monitors simultaneously while completing a 69-min protocol. The monitors included the BodyMedia FIT armband worn on the left arm, the DirectLife monitor around the neck, the Fitbit One, the Fitbit Zip, and the ActiGraph worn on the belt, as well as the Jawbone Up and Basis B1 Band monitor on the wrist. The validity of the EE estimates from each monitor was evaluated relative to criterion values concurrently obtained from a portable metabolic system (i.e., Oxycon Mobile). Differences from criterion measures were expressed as a mean absolute percent error and were evaluated using 95{\%} equivalence testing.

RESULTS: For overall group comparisons, the mean absolute percent error values (computed as the average absolute value of the group-level errors) were 9.3{\%}, 10.1{\%}, 10.4{\%}, 12.2{\%}, 12.6{\%}, 12.8{\%}, 13.0{\%}, and 23.5{\%} for the BodyMedia FIT, Fitbit Zip, Fitbit One, Jawbone Up, ActiGraph, DirectLife, NikeFuel Band, and Basis B1 Band, respectively. The results from the equivalence testing showed that the estimates from the BodyMedia FIT, Fitbit Zip, and NikeFuel Band (90{\%} confidence interval = 341.1-359.4) were each within the 10{\%} equivalence zone around the indirect calorimetry estimate.

CONCLUSIONS: The indicators of the agreement clearly favored the BodyMedia FIT armband, but promising preliminary findings were also observed with the Fitbit Zip.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review factors contributing to variation in total daily energy expenditure and its primary components: (1) resting metabolic rate; (2) diet-induced thermogenesis; and (3) activity thermogenesis, including exercise energy expenditure and nonexercise activity. For each component, the expected magnitude of intra-individual variability is also considered. We also reviewed studies that quantified the variability in 24 h energy expenditure. RECENT FINDINGS: In humans, the coefficient of variation in the components of total daily energy expenditure is around 5-8{\%} for resting metabolic rate, 1-2{\%} for exercise energy expenditure, and around 20{\%} for diet-induced thermogenesis. The coefficient of variance for 24 h energy expenditure measured using a room calorimeter for resting metabolic rate is around 5-10{\%}. Thus, these measures are all rather reproducible. Total daily energy expenditure varies several-fold in humans, not due to variation in resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, or exercise thermogenesis, but rather, due to variations in nonexercise activity. A variety of factors impact nonexercise activity, including occupation, environment, education, genetics, age, gender, and body composition, but little is known about the magnitude of effect. SUMMARY: Resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, exercise energy expenditure, and 24 h energy expenditure are highly reproducible. Coefficient of variation is smallest for exercise energy expenditure, followed by resting metabolic rate, 24 h energy expenditure, and diet-induced thermogenesis. There is considerable variability in total daily energy expenditure, largely due to variations in nonexercise activity. Although the factors that impact upon nonexercise activity are understood, their contribution to variation in total daily energy expenditure is unclear.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To quantify the presence of health behavior theory constructs in iPhone apps targeting physical activity.

METHODS: This study used a content analysis of 127 apps from Apple's (App Store) Health {\&} Fitness category. Coders downloaded the apps and then used an established theory-based instrument to rate each app's inclusion of theoretical constructs from prominent behavior change theories. Five common items were used to measure 20 theoretical constructs, for a total of 100 items. A theory score was calculated for each app. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with higher theory scores.

RESULTS: Apps were generally observed to be lacking in theoretical content. Theory scores ranged from 1 to 28 on a 100-point scale. The health belief model was the most prevalent theory, accounting for 32{\%} of all constructs. Regression analyses indicated that higher priced apps and apps that addressed a broader activity spectrum were associated with higher total theory scores.

CONCLUSION: It is not unexpected that apps contained only minimal theoretical content, given that app developers come from a variety of backgrounds and many are not trained in the application of health behavior theory. The relationship between price and theory score corroborates research indicating that higher quality apps are more expensive. There is an opportunity for health and behavior change experts to partner with app developers to incorporate behavior change theories into the development of apps. These future collaborations between health behavior change experts and app developers could foster apps superior in both theory and programming possibly resulting in better health outcomes.},

abstract = {Progress in transdisciplinary research addressing the health effects of the food and physical activity environments appears hampered by several methodologic obstacles, including: (1) the absence of clear, testable conceptual models; (2) slow adoption of practicable, rigorous research designs; (3) improper use of analytic techniques; and (4) concerns about ubiquitous measurement error. The consequence of such obstacles is that data collected as part of the typical study are more complex than need be. We offer diagnoses and recommendations from an NIH-sponsored meeting that addressed core issues in food- and physical activity-environment research. Recommendations include improved conceptual models and more elaborate theories, experimental thinking and increased attention to causal effect estimation, adoption of cross-validation techniques, use of existing measurement-error models, and increased support for methodologic research.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective. To explore the association between home environmental variables and television (TV) time, and the mediating pathways underlying this association. Methods. The current study used data from the longitudinal ENDORSE study. Self-reported data was available for 1 265 adolescents (mean age of 12{\&}{\#}x2013;15 years at baseline) on home environment (availability of a TV in the bedroom, perceived parental modelling, family rules), potential mediators (intention, attitude, perceived behavioural control, subjective norm towards TV viewing) and TV viewing time. Mediation analyses were conducted using General Estimating Equations and mediation effects were calculated as the product-of-coefficients. Results. Significant overall positive associations were found for the presence of a TV in the bedroom and parental modelling with self-reported TV viewing. Controlling family rules showed an inverse association with reported TV time. Similarly, parental modelling and a TV in the bedroom were significantly positively associated with the Theory of Planned Behaviour variables and habit strength, while family rules showed an inverse association with these potential mediators. In turn, most potential mediators were positively associated with TV viewing. Intention, attitude and habit strength were the strongest mediators in all three associations explaining more than 55{\%} of the overall association. Habit strength alone explained 38.2{\%}{\&}{\#}x2013;58.0{\%} of the overall associations. Conclusions. Home and family environmental predictors of TV time among adolescents may be strongly mediated by habit strength and other personal factors. Future intervention studies should explore if changes in home and family environments indeed lead to reductions in TV time through these mediators.},

abstract = {Getting enough sleep, exercising and limiting sedentary activities can greatly contribute to disease prevention and overall health and longevity. Measuring the full 24-hour activity cycle - sleep, sedentary behavior (SED), light intensity physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) - may now be feasible using small wearable devices.

PURPOSE: This study compares nine devices for accuracy in 24-hour activity measurement.

METHODS: Adults (N=40, 47{\%} male) wore nine devices for 24-hours: Actigraph GT3X+, activPAL, Fitbit One, GENEactiv, Jawbone Up, LUMOback, Nike Fuelband, Omron pedometer, and Z-Machine. Comparisons (to standards) were made for total sleep time (Z-machine), time spent in SED (activPAL), LPA (GT3x+), MVPA (GT3x+), and steps (Omron). Analysis included mean absolute percent error, equivalence testing, and Bland-Altman plots.

RESULTS: Error rates ranged from 8.1-16.9{\%} for sleep; 9.5-65.8{\%} for SED; 19.7-28.0{\%} for LPA; 51.8-92{\%} for MVPA; and 14.1-29.9{\%} for steps. Equivalence testing indicated only two comparisons were significantly equivalent to standards: the LUMOback for sedentary behavior and the GT3X+ for sleep. Bland-Altman plots indicated GT3X+ had the closest measurement for sleep, LUMOback for sedentary behavior, GENEactiv for LPA, Fitbit for MVPA and GT3X+ for steps.

CONCLUSIONS: Currently, no device accurately captures activity data across the entire 24-hour day, but the future of activity measurement should aim for accurate 24-hour measurement as a goal. Researchers should continue to select measurement devices based on their primary outcomes of interest.},

abstract = {Although physicians recognize the importance of physical activity in the prevention and maintenance of chronic diseases [1], few incorpo-rate physical activity counseling into routine clinic visits [2]. One major barrier has been the paucity of means to objectively assess patient's long-term physical activity patterns [3]. We investigated if the Fitbit®, one of the most common wireless physical activity trackers in the consumer market, met reasonable validity and reliability stan-dards such that they could be used by primary care physicians to mon-itor their patient's physical activity objectively between clinic visits. Twenty-three healthy adult participants (10 males; age range: 20–54 years; body mass index range: 19.6–29.9 kg/m 2) completed a four-stage treadmill exercise protocol consisting of walking at slow (1.9 mph), moderate (3.0 mph), and brisk (4.0 mph) paces; and jogging (5.2 mph). Each stage was 6 min in duration. Partici-pants were fitted with three hip-based Fitbit One® (two on the right, one on the left hip) and two wrist-based Fitbit Flex® (one on the right and left wrists) devices. Minute-by-minute estimated-energy expenditure and step counts from Fitbit® devices were extract-ed from the manufacturer's website using Fitabase (Small Steps Labs). Energy expenditure was assessed by gas exchange indirect calorimetry (Ultima CPX, MedGraphics) and aggregated to minute-by-minute epochs. Steps were assessed by manual counting of a video recording in minute epochs. Estimated-step counts and energy expenditure from Fitbit® devices were compared to criterion measures of observed step counts and energy expenditure from indirect calorimetry, respec-tively. All minutes from each stage were analyzed. This study adhered to the guidelines set forth by the Declaration of Helsinki and was ap-proved by the institutional review board at the participating institution. All participants provided informed consent. Estimated step counts from the hip-and wrist-based Fitbit® devices strongly correlated with observed step counts (Fig. 1, panels A, B). Across phases, the within-participant correlation of Fitbit-estimated step counts to observed step counts was 0.97–0.99 for all hip devices and 0.77–0.85 for wrist devices. The mean difference of Fitbit-estimated step counts from observed step counts ranged from −3.1 to − 0.3 steps and − 26.3 steps to − 2.9 steps for the hip-and wrist-based devices, respectively (Table 1, top panel). The greatest differences were seen in the wrist-based Fitbit® during slow, moderate, and brisk walking as step counts were underestimated during these stages by 16.3{\%}, 10.6{\%}, and 11.3{\%}, respectively (right wrist). Hip-and wrist-based Fitbit® estimates of energy expenditure strongly correlated with measured energy expenditure (Fig. 1, panels C, D). Across phases, the within-participant correlation of Fitbit-estimated energy ex-penditure to measured energy expenditure was 0.86–0.87 for all hip de-vices and 0.88 for both wrist devices. The mean difference of Fitbit-estimated energy expenditure from measured energy expenditure ranged from −0.8 to 0.4 kcals and − 0.2 to 2.6 kcals for the hip-and wrist-based Fitbit® devices, respectively (Table 1, bottom panel). The largest discrepancies were seen in the wrist-based Fitbit® during moder-ate and brisk walking as energy expenditure was overestimated during these stages by 52.4{\%} and 33.3{\%}, respectively (right wrist). Inter-device correlations between Fitbit-estimated step counts and energy expenditure of the right hip devices were 0.99 (steps) and 0.96 (energy expenditure), between the right and left hip devices were 0.99 (steps) and 0.97 (energy expenditure), and between the right and left wrist devices were 0.90 (steps) and 0.95 (energy expenditure). Our study shows that the Fitbit One® and Fitbit Flex® reasonably and reliably estimate step counts and energy expenditure during walking and running (two of the most common activities among},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the use of standing 'hot' desks in an open plan office and their impact on sedentary work time. METHOD: Australian employees (n=11; 46.9 [9.8] years; BMI 25.9 [3.5kg/m(2)]) wore an armband accelerometer for two consecutive working weeks (November-December 2010). In the second week, employees were encouraged to use a pod of four standing 'hot' desks to stand and work as often as possible. Desk use was recorded using time logs. The percentages of daily work time spent in sedentary (<1.6 METs), light (1.6-3.0 METs) and moderate+ (>3 METs) intensity categories were calculated for each week, relative to the total daily time at work. Paired sample t tests were used to compare weekly differences. RESULTS: Employees spent 8:09±0:31h/day at work and 'hot' desk use ranged from zero to 9:35h for the week. There were no significant changes in mean time spent in sedentary (difference of -0.1{\%}), light (difference of 0.8{\%}) and moderate+ (-0.7{\%}) intensity categories. However, individual changes in sedentary work time ranged from -5.9 to 6.4{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Volitional use of standing 'hot' desks varied and while individual changes were apparent, desk use did not alter overall sedentary work time in this sample.},

abstract = {Context: Abdominal obesity is a major risk factor for muscle insulin resistance. Mitochondria may play a key role in this etiology. Objective: Changes in muscle mitochondrial content and function were examined according to abdominal obesity and insulin sensitivity in men. Study Design and Setting: The descriptive MitHyCal study was conducted on the general population of Clermont-Ferrand, France. Participants: Forty-two healthy sedentary men (41.7 +/- 4.3 yr) were divided into four groups according to waist circumference: 87 cm or less (group 1, n = 10); 88-93 cm (group 2, n = 12); 94-101 cm (group 3, n = 10); and 102 cm or greater (group 4, n = 10). Intervention: Plasma metabolic check-up was performed, and insulin sensitivity index was calculated from glucose and insulin responses to a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. Muscle biopsies were obtained to assess mitochondrial content, oxidative phosphorylation activity, and superoxide anion (reactive oxygen species) production. Main Outcome Measures: Assessment of muscle mitochondrial content and function was planned before data collection began. Results: Abdominal obesity was negatively correlated to insulin sensitivity index (r = $\backslash$-0.39; P < 0.01), and only group 4 was insulin-resistant (P < 0.05). There were no between-group differences in muscle mitochondrial content and maximal activity of key oxidative enzymes. In contrast, muscle mitochondrial ADP-stimulated respiration rate was 24{\%} higher in groups 2 and 3 compared to groups 1 and 4 (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial ATP and reactive oxygen species production rates were 27 and 48{\%} lower in group 4 than in group 1 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Abdominal obesity is associated with alterations in intrinsic muscle mitochondrial function but not content. These adaptations mainly result in reduced mitochondrial ATP production rate in response to insulin resistance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We estimated the prevalence of overweight and diabetes among US immigrants by region of birth. METHODS: We analyzed data on 34 456 US immigrant adults from the National Health Interview Survey, pooling years 1997 to 2005. We estimated age- and gender-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted overweight and diabetes prevalence by region of birth using logistic regression. RESULTS: Both men (odds ratio [OR] = 3.3; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.9, 5.8) and women (OR = 4.2; 95{\%} CI = 2.3, 7.7) from the Indian subcontinent were more likely than were European migrants to have diabetes without corresponding increased risk of being overweight. Men and women from Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean were more likely to be overweight (men: OR = 1.5; 95{\%} CI = 1.3, 1.7; women: OR = 2.0; 95{\%} CI = 1.7, 2.2) and to have diabetes (men: OR = 2.0; 95{\%} CI = 1.4, 2.9; women: OR = 2.0; 95{\%} CI = 1.4, 2.8) than were European migrants. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable heterogeneity in both prevalence of overweight and diabetes by region of birth highlights the importance of making this distinction among US immigrants to better identify subgroups with higher risks of these conditions.},

abstract = {AIM: To examine differences in non-occupational physical activity behaviour in workers who engage in high and low occupational physical activity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of 112 otherwise comparable volunteers in active (56 walking postal delivery workers) or inactive (56 administrative postal workers) occupations in Glasgow (Scotland) in 2007. METHODS: Twenty four-hour physical activity (steps and time standing, walking and sedentary) patterns were measured using activPAL™ for seven days. Comparisons were made during 8-hour work-shifts, during non-work hours on work-days and during the 2 non-work days. RESULTS: Age and body mass index of delivery and office staff, respectively, were (means (SD)) 38 (9) years versus 40 (7) years and 26.3 (3) kg m(-2) versus 27.4 (4) kg m(-2). Delivery staff spent substantially longer time than office staff upright (6.0 (1.1) h versus 3.9 (1.5) h) and walking (3.1 (0.7) h versus 1.6 (0.7) h) and amassed more steps (16,035 (4264) versus 6709 (2808)) during 8-hour work-shifts and over 24h on work days. During non-work hours of work-days and during non-work days, there were no significant differences in physical activity between the groups. The results were unchanged when the 15 women were excluded. CONCLUSION: Having a more active occupation is not associated with more inactivity during non-work hours.},

The present study employed an Internet-based intervention to increase walking in 12 sedentary adults over 50 years of age. In Experiment 1, participants received monetary consequences for meeting an increasing series of step goals on at least 3 days during consecutive 5-day blocks. Across participants, steps increased 182{\%} from screening to the end of the intervention, and 87{\%} of step goals were met. In Experiment 2, goals were set using the same schedule as in Experiment 1, but no monetary consequences were provided for meeting them. Across participants, steps increased 108{\%}, and 52{\%} of goals were met. Across both studies, 11 of 12 participants increased their steps according to experimenter-arranged criteria. These results support the efficacy of an Internet-based intervention to increase walking in sedentary adults.},

abstract = {In 2001, the 77th Texas legislature passed Senate Bill 19 requiring students in publicly funded elementary schools to participate in physical activity and schools to implement a coordinated school health program by September 1, 2007. We report on awareness of and adherence to Senate Bill 19 in a statewide sample of elementary schools and a subsample in two public health regions located along the Texas-Mexico border. Statewide, structured interviews with principals indicated high awareness of Senate Bill 19's requirements, but lower awareness of the need for parental involvement. Only 43{\%} of Texas schools had adopted their coordinated program 1 year or less before the implementation deadline. Principals reported an average of 179 min of physical education per week, higher than the 135-min mandate. Among the subsample border schools, principals' physical activity reports were consistent with teacher records and student reports. Further, direct observation of physical education indicated that 50{\%} of class time was spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity, meeting the level of physical activity intensity recommended by Healthy People 2010. The differences observed by public health regions included: more physical activity minutes in Region 10 (231 min compared to 217 min in Region 11); higher adoption of coordinated school health programs (92{\%} compared to 75{\%}); more district-level school health advisory committees (58{\%} compared to 38{\%}) and school-level school health advisory committees (83{\%} compared to 25{\%}); and a lower prevalence of obesity in 4th grade students (21{\%} compared to 32{\%}). Differences by region suggest that Senate Bill 19 is not being adhered to equally across the state, and some regions may require further support to increase implementation. Results underscore the importance of continued monitoring of enacted legislation, and that legislation for child health that focuses on school programs and policies requires funding and refinement to produce the intended effect.},

abstract = {The cost of a diploid human genome sequence has dropped from about {\$}70M to {\$}2000 since 2007--even as the standards for redundancy have increased from 7x to 40x in order to improve call rates. Coupled with the low return on investment for common single-nucleotide polylmorphisms, this has caused a significant rise in interest in correlating genome sequences with comprehensive environmental and trait data (GET). The cost of electronic health records, imaging, and microbial, immunological, and behavioral data are also dropping quickly. Sharing such integrated GET datasets and their interpretations with a diversity of researchers and research subjects highlights the need for informed-consent models capable of addressing novel privacy and other issues, as well as for flexible data-sharing resources that make materials and data available with minimum restrictions on use. This article examines the Personal Genome Project's effort to develop a GET database as a public genomics resource broadly accessible to both researchers and research participants, while pursuing the highest standards in research ethics.},

@article{Dannecker2013,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Accurately and precisely estimating free-living energy expenditure (EE) is important for monitoring energy balance and quantifying physical activity. Recently, single and multisensor devices have been developed that can classify physical activities, potentially resulting in improved estimates of EE.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the validity of EE estimation of a footwear-based physical activity monitor and to compare this validity against a variety of research and consumer physical activity monitors.

METHODS: Nineteen healthy young adults (10 men, 9 women) completed a 4-h stay in a room calorimeter. Participants wore a footwear-based physical activity monitor as well as Actical, ActiGraph, IDEEA, DirectLife, and Fitbit devices. Each individual performed a series of postures/activities. We developed models to estimate EE from the footwear-based device, and we used the manufacturer's software to estimate EE for all other devices.

RESULTS: Estimated EE using the shoe-based device was not significantly different than measured EE (mean ± SE; 476 ± 20 vs 478 ± 18 kcal, respectively) and had a root-mean-square error of 29.6 kcal (6.2{\%}). The IDEEA and the DirectLlife estimates of EE were not significantly different than the measured EE, but the ActiGraph and the Fitbit devices significantly underestimated EE. Root-mean-square errors were 93.5 (19{\%}), 62.1 kcal (14{\%}), 88.2 kcal (18{\%}), 136.6 kcal (27{\%}), 130.1 kcal (26{\%}), and 143.2 kcal (28{\%}) for Actical, DirectLife, IDEEA, ActiGraph, and Fitbit, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: The shoe-based physical activity monitor provides a valid estimate of EE, whereas the other physical activity monitors tested have a wide range of validity when estimating EE. Our results also demonstrate that estimating EE based on classification of physical activities can be more accurate and precise than estimating EE based on total physical activity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the sex-specific patterns of school children's daily pedometer-determined physical (PA) during physical education (PE), recess and lunchtime, and before and after school. METHODS: Eighty-one sixth-grade students (28 boys, age = 11.9 +/- 0.4 yr, BMI = 18.8 +/- 4.1 kg x m(-2); 53 girls, 11.8 +/- 0.5 yr, BMI = 20.2 +/- 4.6 kg x m(-2)) wore pedometers for four school days and were prompted to record steps accumulated at arrival and departure from school and during pre- and postrecess, lunchtime, and PE class. RESULTS: Boys took significantly (P < 0.001) more steps per day than girls: 16,421 +/- 5,444 vs 12,332 +/- 3,056 steps per day, and more steps during release time (e.g., before-school Delta = 1289 steps, recess Delta = 479 steps, lunchtime Delta = 608 steps, and after-school Delta = 1872 steps) but the same number of steps during structured PE classes (1429 +/- 567 vs 1410 +/- 445 steps; P = 0.87). Lunchtime PA represented the most important source of daily PA (15-16{\%}) obtained during school hours for both boys and girls, whereas recess accounted for 8-9{\%} and PE class accounted for 8-11{\%} of total steps per day. Regardless, almost half of daily steps taken are attributable to after-school activities. CONCLUSION: These data provide greater understanding of sex-specific PA patterns and the relative contribution of distinct segments of the school day to school children's total PA.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physicians have limited time for weight-loss counseling, and there is a lack of resources to which they can refer patients for assistance with weight loss. Weight-loss mobile applications (apps) have the potential to be a helpful tool, but the extent to which they include the behavioral strategies included in evidence-based interventions is unknown.

PURPOSE: The primary aims of the study were to determine the degree to which commercial weight-loss mobile apps include the behavioral strategies included in evidence-based weight-loss interventions, and to identify features that enhance behavioral strategies via technology.

METHODS: Thirty weight-loss mobile apps, available on iPhone and/or Android platforms, were coded for whether they included any of 20 behavioral strategies derived from an evidence-based weight-loss program (i.e., Diabetes Prevention Program). Data on available apps were collected in January 2012; data were analyzed in June 2012.

RESULTS: The apps included on average 18.83{\%} (SD=13.24; range=0{\%}-65{\%}) of the 20 strategies. Seven of the strategies were not found in any app. The most common technology-enhanced features were barcode scanners (56.7{\%}) and a social network (46.7{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS: Weight-loss mobile apps typically included only a minority of the behavioral strategies found in evidence-based weight-loss interventions. Behavioral strategies that help improve motivation, reduce stress, and assist with problem solving were missing across apps. Inclusion of additional strategies could make apps more helpful to users who have motivational challenges.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary aim of this pilot study was to assess how well the combination of global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data predicted different activity modes. METHODS: Ten adults (seven male, three female; 23-51 yr) simultaneously wore a GPS unit and accelerometer during bouts of walking, jogging/running, bicycling, inline skating, or driving an automobile. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify a parsimonious combination of variables derived from accelerometer counts and steps and GPS speed that best classified mode. A total of 29 bouts were used to develop this classification criterion. This criterion was validated using two datasets generated from the complete collection of minute-by-minute values from all bouts. RESULTS: Model development with "calibration" data showed that two accelerometer variables alone (median counts and steps) resulted in 26 of 29 bouts (90{\%}) being correctly classified. Prediction of activity mode using counts and steps in a minute-by-minute "validation" dataset (N = 200) was 86.5{\%}. Using three variables from the accelerometer and GPS (median counts, steps and speed) resulted in correct classification in 27 of 29 activity bouts in the "calibration" data (93{\%}). In the "validation" dataset comprising 200 min, the combination of accelerometer counts and steps and GPS speed were able to correctly classify 91{\%} of the observations. Walking and bicycling minutes were correctly classified most frequently (96{\%}). In another "validation" dataset consisting of activity bouts, this combination of variables resulted in correct classification in 42 of 43 bouts (98{\%}). CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides evidence that the addition of GPS to accelerometer monitoring improves physical activity mode classification to a small degree. Larger studies among free-living individuals and with an expanded range of activities are needed to replicate the current findings and further determine the merits of using GPS with accelerometers for mode identification.},

Participants were 37 college employees who volunteered to participate in the study. The intervention consisted of goal setting, pedometer use, self-monitoring, and weekly e-mail reminders. Physical activity measures (pedometer, survey) were taken at baseline and immediately following the intervention. A t-test far paired samples was used to determine significant changes in measures. Results. Results indicate a significant increase in average daily steps (p < . 01), from 8565 ({\^{A}}± 3121) steps at baseline to 10,538 ({\^{A}}± 3681) steps after the program. Participants who averaged fewer than 6000 steps and obese participants experienced the greatest increase. Discussion. Although preliminary, this study indicates that the minimal contact, selfmanaged, pedometer-based lifestyle intervention was effective in increasing the daily physical activity of participants. Given the combination of behavioral techniques used, a recommendation for future studies would be to examine the impact of individual behavioral techniques on daily physical activity.

We used telephone survey methods to measure suitableness of the perceived (vs objective) environment for recreational physical activity and nonmotorized transportation. RESULTS: Most questions in our surveys that attempted to measure specific characteristics of the built environment showed moderate to high reliability. Questions about the social environment showed lower reliability than those that assessed the physical environment. Certain blocks of questions appeared to be selectively more reliable for urban or rural respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in content and in response formats, all 3 surveys showed evidence of reliability, and most items are now ready for use in research and in public health surveillance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of structured vs. non-structured internet-delivered exercise recommendations on aerobic exercise capacity and cardiovascular risk profile in overweight sedentary employees. METHODS: 140 employees of an automobile company (11{\%} female, median age 48years (range 25-60), BMI 29.0kg/m(2) (25.0-34.8)) were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to an intervention group receiving structured exercise schedules or a control group choosing workouts individually via an interactive website. The 12-week intervention took place in Munich, Germany, during summer 2008. Main outcome measure was performance at the lactate anaerobic threshold (P(AT)/kg) during ergometry. RESULTS: 77 participants completed the study. The intervention group (n=50) improved significantly in P(AT)/kg ((mean (SD)) 1.68 (0.31) vs. 1.81 (0.33) W/kg; p=0.002), VO(2)peak (3.21 (0.63) vs. 3.35 (0.74) L/min; p=0.04), and waist circumference (100.5 (7.9) vs. 98.0 (7.8) cm; p=0.001). The control group (n=27) improved significantly in P(AT)/kg (1.59 (0.38) vs. 1.80 (0.49); p<0.001) and waist circumference (101.9 (8.7) vs. 98.3 (8.5) cm; p<0.001), but not in VO(2)peak. No significant between group differences in these outcome measures were noted. CONCLUSION: Structured, internet-delivered exercise recommendations are not superior to internet-delivered non-structured exercise recommendations in a workplace setting. Both lifestyle intervention strategies are, however, limited by high dropout rates. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00686244.},

METHODS: We constructed models to simulate the costs of excess obesity and associated diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD) among adults aged 35-64 years in the US population in 2020 to 2050. RESULTS: Current adolescent overweight is projected to result in 161 million life-years complicated by obesity, diabetes, or CHD and 1.5 million life-years lost. The cumulative excess attributable total costs are estimated at {\$}254 billion: {\$}208 billion because of lost productivity from earlier death or morbidity and {\$}46 billion from direct medical costs. Currently available therapies for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, used according to guidelines, if applied in the future, would result in modest reductions in excess mortality (decreased to 1.1 million life-years lost) but increase total excess costs by another {\$}7 billion (increased to {\$}261 billion total). CONCLUSIONS: Current adolescent overweight will likely lead to large future economic and health burdens, especially lost productivity from premature death and disability. Application of currently available medical treatments will not greatly reduce these future burdens of increased adult obesity.},

We examined the validity and long-term usability of the Fitbit One Pedometer in COPD patients. In study A, COPD patients (n=11;FEV1{\%}Pred 34.5 ±12;age, 69.6 ±6.5, 55{\%} male) simultaneously wore the Fitbit one and the Actigraph GT3X activity monitor for 7 days. Study B, COPD patients (n=7;age, 63 ±6, FEV1{\%}Pred 45±11) completed a usability questionnaire and participanted in qualitative interviews. Bland-Altman plots
showed good agreement between daily step counts from the Fitbit One and the Actigraph, and intraclass correlations of 0.9 (CI: 07-0.9). Overall there was high usage, acceptability and satisfaction with the pedometer in terms of comfort and appearance and 60{\%} of patients reported willingness to use it for longer than 12 months. Usability issues registered include replacement due to loss (n=02) and underestimation of daily stairs. Qualitative interviews revealed that COPD patients feel more empowered using a self-monitoring tool, but they have expectations to understand the accuracy of other physical activity outcomes including daily stairs, minutes active and calories. These results suggest that the Fitbit One is a valid device to count steps in COPD patients and feasible for long-term usability, but other activity outcomes from this pedometer requires further testing.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Without detailed evidence of their effectiveness, pedometers have recently become popular as a tool for motivating physical activity.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of pedometer use with physical activity and health outcomes among outpatient adults.

DATA SOURCES: English-language articles from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport Discus, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, Thompson Scientific (formerly known as Thompson ISI), and ERIC (1966-2007); bibliographies of retrieved articles; and conference proceedings.

STUDY SELECTION: Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported an assessment of pedometer use among adult outpatients, reported a change in steps per day, and included more than 5 participants.

DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently abstracted data about the intervention; participants; number of steps per day; and presence or absence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Data were pooled using random-effects calculations, and meta-regression was performed.

RESULTS: Our searches identified 2246 citations; 26 studies with a total of 2767 participants met inclusion criteria (8 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 18 observational studies). The participants' mean (SD) age was 49 (9) years and 85{\%} were women. The mean intervention duration was 18 weeks. In the RCTs, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2491 steps per day more than control participants (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1098-3885 steps per day, P < .001). Among the observational studies, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2183 steps per day over baseline (95{\%} CI, 1571-2796 steps per day, P < .0001). Overall, pedometer users increased their physical activity by 26.9{\%} over baseline. An important predictor of increased physical activity was having a step goal such as 10,000 steps per day (P = .001). When data from all studies were combined, pedometer users significantly decreased their body mass index by 0.38 (95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.72; P = .03). This decrease was associated with older age (P = .001) and having a step goal (P = .04). Intervention participants significantly decreased their systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mm Hg (95{\%} CI, 1.7-5.9 mm Hg, P < .001). This decrease was associated with greater baseline systolic blood pressure (P = .009) and change in steps per day (P = .08).

CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the use of a pedometer is associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in body mass index and blood pressure. Whether these changes are durable over the long term is undetermined.},

We examined the theoretical assumptions and methodological limitations of acculturation research in understanding Latino health care disparities, the evidence for socioeconomic position as a predictor of health care disparities, and the effectiveness of cultural competency practice. Persistent use of culture-driven acculturation models decenters social determinants of health as key factors in health disparities and diminishes the effectiveness of cultural competency practice. Social and economic determinants are more important predictors than is culture in understanding health care disparities.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In Australia and the USA, national guidelines exist for limiting children's screen-exposure to two hours per day. This study aims to determine whether exceeding the suggested guidelines for screen-based sedentary behavior is associated with reduced levels of physical activity across different geographical regions. METHODS: Data material were taken from the 2005/2006 survey of "Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study; A WHO cross-National Survey". Data were collected through questionnaires from 11-,13- and,15- year olds. The final sample included 200,615 adolescents from 39 different countries in Europe and North America. Gender and country stratified analyses regressed time spent in leisure-time vigorous physical activity (VPA) and days of 60 minutes moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on time spent in screen-based sedentary behaviors. To simplify interpretation, the estimates from each country were pooled using a meta-analytic procedure. RESULTS: Exceeding 2 hrs of daily total screen-time was negatively associated with MVPA for both boys and girls, and with VPA for girls. When investigating the different types of screen-based behaviors separately, exceeding 2 hrs daily of TV viewing was associated with less MVPA for both boys and girls and less VPA for girls. Gaming was associated with less MVPA and VPA for boys, and non-gaming computer use was associated with higher levels of VPA for both genders. Stronger negative associations between physical activity and screen-based sedentary behaviors were found in countries where mean levels of physical activity were relatively high. The association between physical activity and sedentary behavior was not significantly associated with national levels of screen-based sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The displacement mechanism does not appear to be universal across countries. On a national level, negative associations between physical activity and screen-based sedentary behaviors are less likely to be found in countries with relatively low levels of physical activity. Consequently, national guidelines for limiting children and adolescents time in screen-based sedentary behavior may not be conducive to increasing levels of physical activity in all countries.},

@article{Wen2012,
abstract = {Exercise has been called a miracle drug1 that can benefit every part of the body2 and substantially extend lifespan.3 Yet it receives little respect from doctors or society.4 Socially, being inactive is perceived as normal, and in fact doctors order patients to remain on bed rest far more often than they encourage exercise.5 This passive attitude towards inactivity, where exercise is viewed as a personal choice, is anachronistic, and is reminiscent of the battles still being fought over smoking. Physical inactivity burdens society through the hidden and growing cost of medical care and loss of productivity. Getting the public to exercise is a public health priority because inactive people are contributing to a mortality burden as large as tobacco smoking. To individuals, the failure to spend 15—30 min a day in brisk walking increases the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes by 20—30{\%},3, 5 and shortens lifespan by 3—5 years.3 Although the benefits of exercise and the harms of inactivity might seem like two sides of a coin, the benefits message emphasised so far has not worked well for most of the population. In tobacco control, doctors did not emphasise the benefits of non-smoking, but the harms of smoking. Similarly, armed with credible global and national data, we should emphasise the harms of inactivity and not merely the benefits of exercise. Smoking and physical inactivity are the two major risk factors for non-communicable diseases around the globe. Of the 36 million deaths each year from non-communicable diseases,6 physical inactivity5 and smoking each contribute about 5 million.7 Physical inactivity and smoking have similar population attributable risks, although their relative risks8, 9 and prevalence are somewhat different (figure). For smoking, intensive and coordinated tobacco control efforts have been organised through WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), a treaty already ratified by 175 countries.10 By contrast, we have few organised efforts to combat physical inactivity. Governmental programmes to move people from sedentary living to meeting recommended levels of exercise are very limited, in both developed and developing countries. Where available, these programmes are viewed as useful but not as essential as, say, anti-smoking programmes, partly owing to a failure to emphasise the colossal harms of inactivity. Furthermore, treatment of physical inactivity is not a reimbursable item under most health insurance programmes, and few financial incentives exist for health-care providers to spend time discussing exercise during medical visits. Estimates of the effect of inactivity on non-communicable diseases, such as a 6—10{\%} contribution, are very conservative as reported by one of the papers5 in this Series. First, the minimally active population might not be separated from those who are completely inactive, with a 3-year gap in life expectancy reported between the two groups.3 The largest health gain occurs for the first 15—29 min per day of exercise by inactive people.3, 11 Second, the prevalence of inactivity could be underestimated substantially, particularly in Asian countries where up to 80{\%} national prevalence for inactivity has been reported.3, 12 Third, if the life expectancy gap between active and inactive people were to be derived from summary risk estimates, underestimation would occur if adjusted rather than unadjusted relative risks were used, or if mortality risks were not constant across age groups.13 Finally, the small increase in the estimated life expectancy gap8 should be read with caution as it is relevant to the population as a whole, and is not limited to inactive people. There is much to learn from tobacco control strategies to reduce the harms of inactivity. WHO introduced the MPOWER measures to assist in reducing smoking harms at the country level.14 MPOWER includes monitoring behaviour, protecting people from smoke, offering treatment, warning of harms, enforcing the law, and raising the price. Applying MPOWER to physical inactivity, we will need to monitor inactivity prevalence and factors behind it; protect the safety of the exercisers and their built environment;15 offer services to the inactive to gain skills for sustainable and enjoyable exercise; warn the public of the hazards of inactivity through repeated campaigns; ensure that the medical community fulfils its responsibility to reduce inactivity; and, finally, raise money or provide funding to encourage physical activity and discourage inactivity. In addition to doctors' traditional advocacy of the health benefits of exercise, stressing the harms of inactivity could strengthen our battle against inactivity. We need to view the inactive population as abnormal and consider them at high risk of disease. If we accept this view, governmental programmes modelled on MPOWER to diminish physical inactivity could be justified, with commensurate resources committed in each country to tackle the major threat to human health of non-communicable diseases. We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.},

abstract = {It is now known that nearly half of the toll that illness takes in developed countries is linked to four unhealthy behaviors: smoking, excess alcohol intake, poor diet, and physical inactivity. These common risk behaviors cause preventable, delayed illness that then manifests as chronic disease, requiring extended medical care with associated financial costs. Chronic disease already accounts for 75{\%} of U.S. health-care costs, foreshadowing an unsustainable financial burden for the aging population [1]. We are facing an urgent need to re-engineer health systems to improve public health through behavior change, and technology-supported behavioral change interventions will be a part of 21st-century health care. As new technical capabilities to observe behavior continuously in context make it possible to tailor interventions in real time, the way we understand and try to influence behavior will change fundamentally.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is little national research on longitudinal patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior in ethnically diverse teens as they transition to adulthood. METHODS: Longitudinal questionnaire data from U.S. adolescents enrolled in Wave I (1994-1995) and Wave III (2001) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n =13,030) were analyzed in January 2004. Incidence, reversal, and maintenance of achieving five or more weekly bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and < or =14 hours of weekly TV and video viewing, computer/video game use (screen time) were assessed. Multinomial logistic regression models examined the likelihood of achieving five or more weekly sessions of MVPA week and < or =14 hours screen time per week as an adolescent and/or young adult, controlling for household income, parental education, age of adolescent, and seasonality. RESULTS: Of those achieving five or more weekly sessions of MVPA and < or =14 hours of weekly screen time as adolescents, few continued to achieve these favorable amounts of activity (4.4{\%}) and screen time (37.0{\%}) as adults. More failed to maintain these favorable amounts of activity (31.1{\%}) and screen time (17.3{\%}) into adulthood. Black versus white females were more likely to maintain less [corrected] favorable amounts of activity from adolescence to adulthood (odds ratio [OR]=3.09; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]=1.49-6.42), while black males (OR=1.50; CI=1.05-2.14) and females (OR=2.00; CI=1.40-2.87) were more likely than whites to maintain less (versus more) favorable screen time hours. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of adolescents do not achieve five or more bouts of moderate physical activity per week, and continue to fail to achieve this amount of activity into adulthood.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: There is a lack of large-scale comparable data on the population levels of physical activity and sedentary activity. We conducted a cross sectional population-based multicenter study to describe the levels of physical activity and sedentary activity and to determine adherence to current national physical activity recommendations, in Norwegian adults and older people. METHODS:: In 2008 and 2009, physical activity was assessed objectively for seven consecutive days using the ActiGraph GT1M accelerometer in 3,867 participants aged 20- 85 years. A total of 3267 participants provided valid physical activity assessments that met all inclusion criteria. RESULTS:: Women and men did not differ in the overall activity levels (335 and 342 counts per minute, respectively) or in steps per day (8,113 and 7,951 steps per day, respectively). However, for intensity-specific physical activity, men accumulated significantly more minutes of sedentary activity and moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) physical activity compared with women (557 versus 533 minutes of sedentary activity, P≤0.001, and 35 versus 33 minutes of MVPA, P=0.01). Both overall activity levels and steps per day remained steady with age, until 65 years, after which activity levels declined. CONCLUSIONS:: Overall, the study sample spent 62{\%} of their time being sedentary, 25{\%} in low intensity physical activity, 9{\%} in lifestyle activity and 4{\%} in MVPA. One in five people met current national PA recommendations. These results suggest that adults and older people spend the majority of their time being sedentary, and that adherence to physical activity recommendations is low.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population-based studies directed at promoting physical activity in youth have shown limited success in obesity prevention. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether an intervention integrating environmental changes to induce sustained changes in physical activity, prevents overweight in adolescents. DESIGN: Four-year randomized trial started in 2002 in eight middle schools of Eastern France. The intervention, randomized at school level, was designed to promote physical activity by changing attitudes through debates and attractive activities, and by providing social support and environmental changes encouraging physical activity.Subjects:Nine hundred and fifty four 12-year-old six-graders. MEASUREMENTS: Body mass index (BMI), body composition, physical activity by questionnaire, plasma lipids and glucose, insulin resistance. RESULTS: Intervention students had a lower increase in BMI (P=0.01) and age- and gender-adjusted BMI (P<0.02) over time than controls. The differences across groups of the age- and gender-adjusted BMI changes (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)) were -0.29 (-0.51; -0.07) kg/m2 at 3 years, -0.25 (-0.51; 0.01) kg/m2 at 4 years. An interaction with baseline weight status was noted. The intervention had a significant effect throughout the study in initially non-overweight adolescents (-0.36 (-0.60;-0.11) kg/m2 for adjusted BMI at 4 years), corresponding to a lower increase in fat mass index (P<0.001). In initially overweight adolescents, the differences observed across groups at 2 years (-0.40 (-0.94; 0.13) kg/m2 for adjusted BMI) did not persist over time. At 4 years, 4.2{\%} of the initially non-overweight adolescents were overweight in the intervention schools, 9.8{\%} in the controls (odds ratio=0.41 (0.22; 0.75); P<0.01). Independent of initial weight status, compared with controls, intervention adolescents had an increase in supervised physical activity (P<0.0001), a decrease of TV/video viewing (P<0.01) and an increase of high-density cholesterol concentrations (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Enhancing physical activity with a multilevel program prevents excessive weight gain in non-overweight adolescents. Our study provides evidence that prevention of obesity in youth is feasible.},

I believe it is an important tool for assessing physical activity, because it can simultaneously provide contextually rich data on the setting in which the activity occurs. It is particularly useful for those interested in using ecological and cognitive-behavioral approaches to examine how physical and social environments influence physical activity, and it is currently the only method for assessing group physical activity in open environments. Because physical activity researchers use the method infrequently, this paper provides an overview of systematic observation as it applies to studying physical activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature on the effectiveness of interventions to promote physical activity in children and adolescents. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, Psychlit, Ovid Medline, Sportdiscus, and Embase up to December 2006. Review methods Two independent reviewers assessed studies against the following inclusion criteria: controlled trial, comparison of intervention to promote physical activity with no intervention control condition, participants younger than 18 years, and reported statistical analyses of a physical activity outcome measure. Levels of evidence, accounting for methodological quality, were assessed for three types of intervention, five settings, and three target populations. RESULTS: The literature search identified 57 studies: 33 aimed at children and 24 at adolescents. Twenty four studies were of high methodological quality, including 13 studies in children. Interventions that were found to be effective achieved increases ranging from an additional 2.6 minutes of physical education related physical activity to 283 minutes per week of overall physical activity. Among children, limited evidence for an effect was found for interventions targeting children from low socioeconomic populations, and environmental interventions. Strong evidence was found that school based interventions with involvement of the family or community and multicomponent interventions can increase physical activity in adolescents. CONCLUSION: Some evidence was found for potentially effective strategies to increase children's levels of physical activity. For adolescents, multicomponent interventions and interventions that included both school and family or community involvement have the potential to make important differences to levels of physical activity and should be promoted. A lack of high quality evaluations hampers conclusions concerning effectiveness, especially among children.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Research on geographic differences in children's physical activity (PA) engagement is limited. This study examined the prevalence of PA and sedentary behaviors in a probability sample of children in the 4th (mean age, 9.7 years; n = 7,907), 8th (mean age, 13.7 years; n = 8,827), and 11th (mean age 16.9 years; n = 6,456) grades by urban, suburban, and rural location in Texas. METHODS: Using data from the 2004-2005 School Physical Activity and Nutrition (SPAN) study, we conducted logistic regression analyses stratified by sex to assess associations of 6 PA indicators and 2 sedentary behavior indicators with metropolitan status. RESULTS: Urban 8th- and 11th-grade students reported the lowest prevalence of PA. Suburban or rural schools were significantly more likely than their urban counterparts to report higher school-based sports team participation in 8th graders (P = .001); higher vigorous PA (P = .01) and strengthening exercise (P = .01) in 11th-grade boys; and higher physical education attendance in 4th (P < .01) and 11th graders (P = .05). Sports team (P = .04) and other organized PA participation (P = .04) in urban 4th-grade girls and vigorous PA in urban 8th-grade boys (P = .04) were the only behaviors for which a significantly higher prevalence was reported compared with nonurban counterparts. We observed few significant geographic differences in prevalence of television watching and video game playing. CONCLUSION: Several significant differences in PA behaviors were found by metropolitan status in this sample of public school students in Texas. Research is needed on availability of PA opportunities and PA barriers by metropolitan status to better understand the lower prevalence estimates reported in older urban children.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The prevalence of high body mass index (BMI) among children and adolescents in the United States appeared to plateau between 1999 and 2006. OBJECTIVES: To provide the most recent estimates of high BMI among children and adolescents and high weight for recumbent length among infants and toddlers and to analyze trends in prevalence between 1999 and 2008. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2008, a representative sample of the US population with measured heights and weights on 3281 children and adolescents (2 through 19 years of age) and 719 infants and toddlers (birth to 2 years of age). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of high weight for recumbent length (> or = 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts) among infants and toddlers. Prevalence of high BMI among children and adolescents defined at 3 levels: BMI for age at or above the 97th percentile, at or above the 95th percentile, and at or above the 85th percentile of the BMI-for-age growth charts. Analyses of trends by age, sex, and race/ethnicity from 1999-2000 to 2007-2008. RESULTS: In 2007-2008, 9.5{\%} of infants and toddlers (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 7.3{\%}-11.7{\%}) were at or above the 95th percentile of the weight-for-recumbent-length growth charts. Among children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years, 11.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 9.8{\%}-13.9{\%}) were at or above the 97th percentile of the BMI-for-age growth charts; 16.9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 14.1{\%}-19.6{\%}) were at or above the 95th percentile; and 31.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 29.2{\%}-34.1{\%}) were at or above the 85th percentile of BMI for age. Prevalence estimates differed by age and by race/ethnic group. Trend analyses indicate no significant trend between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008 except at the highest BMI cut point (BMI for age > or = 97th percentile) among all 6- through 19-year-old boys (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95{\%} CI, 1.17-2.01) and among non-Hispanic white boys of the same age (OR, 1.87; 95{\%} CI, 1.22-2.94). CONCLUSION: No statistically significant linear trends in high weight for recumbent length or high BMI were found over the time periods 1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, 2005-2006, and 2007-2008 among girls and boys except among the very heaviest 6- through 19-year-old boys.},

Boys were more active than girls overall and during skill drills, game play, and free play. Student activity varied by lesson context, with fitness activities producing the most activity. Class size was negatively associated with student activity. Daily PE contributed a weekly total of 25 min of vigorous activity and 83 min of moderate-to-vigorous activity--much less than national objectives.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the day-to-day variability of older adults' physical activity, and to evaluate the accuracy of the 10,000-step goal for classifying whether older adults obtain 30 minutes of MVPA.

METHODS: Ninety-one adults of age over 60 years of age wore a Yamax pedometer and Actigraph accelerometer for 7 days. Interday reliability was estimated via two-way ANOVA ICCs, and classification accuracy was evaluated via sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve analysis.

RESULTS: Interday reliability was high; 4 of 5 outcome measures had a reliability of > or = .80 with only 2 days of data. The 10,000-step cut point had high accuracy for identifying days with less than 30 minutes of MVPA, but poor accuracy for identifying days with more than 30 minutes of MVPA.

CONCLUSIONS: Day-to-day variability in physical activity is lower in older adults than other age groups. The 10,000-step goal is inadequate for determining whether daily physical activity includes 30 minutes of MVPA in this population.},

Participants who completed four nonconsecutive, telephone-administered 24-hour dietary recalls (n = 1,301) were mailed a DHQ; 965 respondents completed both the 24-hour dietary recalls and the DHQ. The US Department of Agriculture's Pyramid Servings Database was used to estimate intakes of pyramid servings for both diet assessment tools. The correlation (rho) between DHQ-reported intake and true intake and the attenuation factor (lambda) were estimated using a measurement error model with repeat 24-hour dietary recalls as the reference instrument. Correlations for energy-adjusted pyramid servings of foods ranged from 0.43 (other starchy vegetables) to 0.84 (milk) among women and from 0.42 (eggs) to 0.80 (total dairy food) among men. The mean rho and lambda after energy adjustment were 0.62 and 0.60 for women and 0.63 and 0.66 for men, respectively. This food frequency questionnaire validation study of foods measured in pyramid servings allowed for a measure of food intake consistent with national dietary guidance.},

abstract = {The relationship between television (TV) viewing and overweight in children is likely to be influenced by the quality of measures used. We systematically reviewed studies related to overweight in children that had included a measure of TV exposure. Literature searches were conducted in MedLINE, PsychInfo, SportDiscus and ISIWeb of Science. Methods of assessing TV viewing were evaluated, including the type of measure, the administration procedure and reported psychometric properties. The majority of studies assessed TV viewing using self-report surveys and very few studies used direct observation. The validity or reliability of measures was often not examined. The majority of tools that were evaluated were compared with another self-report measure or an objective measure of physical activity. TV viewing measures should be selected that are specific to the research question, the study design, as well as methodological feasibility. However, it is recommended that measures of TV viewing be used only if they have psychometric data to support their validity and reliability. Selecting measures that are valid and reliable enables us to examine with greater accuracy the influence of TV viewing on childhood overweight, as well as the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce TV viewing in children.},

@misc{Choi2007a,
abstract = {Background: This review looks at ways to increase physical activity, by walking and other sports and home activities, to reach the daily 10,000 steps goal.  It also looks at a number of issues associated with achieving the daily step goal, such as considerations in walking, step counting and physical activity.

Methods: The review is based on MEDLINE (1982-2006) and Google searches using keywords “pedometer”, “daily step goal”, “physical activity”, “exercise”.

Results: Research has suggested a daily 10,000 step goal for maintaining a desirable level of physical activity for health.  However, this is not normally achievable through routine daily activities. For many, there is a daily deficit of approximately 4000 steps (most from 3000 to 6000 steps), which must be gained from other more rigorous activities.  This paper provides information based on the Compendium of Physical Activities, to help people to choose their physical activities to supplement their daily steps, through both sports activities and home activities.  It thus helps people to better achieve the goals of Canada's Physical Activity Guide.  There are issues to consider in counting steps.  A pedometer is not an exact method to measure energy expenditure.  Focusing on counting steps may lead to an obsessive attitude toward exercise.  Excessive walking and physical activity may lead to certain health problems.

Discussion: Walking is a practical and fun way to change our sedentary life style and to improve the health of the nation.  When there is a deficit in daily steps, both sports and home activities can be used to supplement the daily steps to reach the daily step goal.  The user-friendly table provided in this paper helps people to identify the sports and home activities, and estimate the durations needed, to meet the daily step goal.},

abstract = {Context Without detailed evidence of their effectiveness, pedometers have recently become popular as a tool for motivating physical activity.Objective To evaluate the association of pedometer use with physical activity and health outcomes among outpatient adults.Data Sources English-language articles from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Sport Discus, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, Thompson Scientific (formerly known as Thompson ISI), and ERIC (1966-2007); bibliographies of retrieved articles; and conference proceedings.Study Selection Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported an assessment of pedometer use among adult outpatients, reported a change in steps per day, and included more than 5 participants.Data Extraction and Data Synthesis Two investigators independently abstracted data about the intervention; participants; number of steps per day; and presence or absence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Data were pooled using random-effects calculations, and meta-regression was performed.Results Our searches identified 2246 citations; 26 studies with a total of 2767 participants met inclusion criteria (8 randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 18 observational studies). The participants' mean (SD) age was 49 (9) years and 85{\%} were women. The mean intervention duration was 18 weeks. In the RCTs, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2491 steps per day more than control participants (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1098-3885 steps per day, P < .001). Among the observational studies, pedometer users significantly increased their physical activity by 2183 steps per day over baseline (95{\%} CI, 1571-2796 steps per day, P < .0001). Overall, pedometer users increased their physical activity by 26.9{\%} over baseline. An important predictor of increased physical activity was having a step goal such as 10 000 steps per day (P = .001). When data from all studies were combined, pedometer users significantly decreased their body mass index by 0.38 (95{\%} CI, 0.05-0.72; P = .03). This decrease was associated with older age (P = .001) and having a step goal (P = .04). Intervention participants significantly decreased their systolic blood pressure by 3.8 mm Hg (95{\%} CI, 1.7-5.9 mm Hg, P < .001). This decrease was associated with greater baseline systolic blood pressure (P = .009) and change in steps per day (P = .08).Conclusions The results suggest that the use of a pedometer is associated with significant increases in physical activity and significant decreases in body mass index and blood pressure. Whether these changes are durable over the long term is undetermined.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a generalized version of the concordance correlation coefficient for agreement data. The concordance correlation coefficient evaluates the accuracy and precision between two measures, and is based on the expected value of the squared function of distance. We have generalized this coefficient by applying alternative functions of distance to produce more robust versions of the concordance correlation coefficient. In this paper we extend the application of this class of estimators to categorical data as well, and demonstrate similarities to the kappa and weighted kappa statistics. We also introduce a stratified concordance correlation coefficient which adjusts for explanatory factors, and an extended concordance correlation coefficient which measures agreement among more than two responses. With these extensions, the generalized concordance correlation coefficient provides a unifying approach to assessing agreement among two or more measures that are either continuous or categorical in scale.},

@article{Abercrombie2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Disparities in health outcomes and health behaviors may be partially explained by neighborhood environments that are poor in resources that could support healthy behaviors. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that low-income and high-minority neighborhoods have less access to public parks, open space, and private recreation facilities. METHODS: From 2004 to 2005, an inventory of 351 private recreation facilities and 465 public parks was conducted in 833 Census block groups in Maryland. In 2-way ANCOVAs, numbers of private facilities and public parks, as well as maximum park size, were studied in relation to categories of median income and percent non-white population in the block groups. RESULTS: For the number of private recreation facilities, there was no significant effect of income or percent minority. For number and size of parks, the interaction between income and percent minority was significant. Mixed-race neighborhoods had the highest number of parks, regardless of income. Low- and middle-income groups living in mostly-white block groups and high-income groups living in mostly-minority block groups had the lowest access to public parks. CONCLUSIONS: The expected deprivation of recreation facilities in low-income and high-minority neighborhoods was not found. There are exceptions to the inequalities found nationally, so the policies or practices associated with a fairer distribution of recreation resources in some local areas need to be better understood.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Demographic and temporal patterns in the social and physical environments of sports and exercise in the American Time Use Survey (years 2003-2006) are described. METHOD: The sample consisted of adult respondents (ages 21+) reporting at least one bout of sports or exercise (N=8844). During the interview, participants reported where (e.g., outdoors, home, work) and with whom (e.g., alone, family, coworkers) each bout occurred. Sample-weighted multinomial logistic regression analyses estimated the adjusted proportion of bouts occurring in each environment by gender, age, education, race/ethnicity, season, weekend/weekday, and time of day. RESULTS: Among members of the oldest age group (ages 60+), more exercise bouts occurred alone and outdoors compared to younger age groups. Among college graduates, more exercise bouts occurred at a gym/health club compared to groups with lower levels of education. Exercise bouts occurring alone were most likely to happen in the winter, on weekdays, and in the morning. Exercise bouts occurring outdoors were most likely to happen in the summer, on weekend days, and in the morning. CONCLUSION: Future research and intervention efforts exploring where, when and with whom exercise bouts occur may prove beneficial to addressing public health concerns about physical inactivity.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Interventions designed to increase workplace physical activity may not automatically reduce high volumes of sitting, a behaviour independently linked to chronic diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes. This study compared the impact two different walking strategies had on step counts and reported sitting times. METHODS: Participants were white-collar university employees (n = 179; age 41.3 +/- 10.1 years; 141 women), who volunteered and undertook a standardised ten-week intervention at three sites. Pre-intervention step counts (Yamax SW-200) and self-reported sitting times were measured over five consecutive workdays. Using pre-intervention step counts, employees at each site were randomly allocated to a control group (n = 60; maintain normal behaviour), a route-based walking group (n = 60; at least 10 minutes sustained walking each workday) or an incidental walking group (n = 59; walking in workday tasks). Workday step counts and reported sitting times were re-assessed at the beginning, mid- and endpoint of intervention and group mean+/- SD steps/day and reported sitting times for pre-intervention and intervention measurement points compared using a mixed factorial ANOVA; paired sample-t-tests were used for follow-up, simple effect analyses. RESULTS: A significant interactive effect (F = 3.5; p < 0.003) was found between group and step counts. Daily steps for controls decreased over the intervention period (-391 steps/day) and increased for route (968 steps/day; t = 3.9, p < 0.000) and incidental (699 steps/day; t = 2.5, p < 0.014) groups. There were no significant changes for reported sitting times, but average values did decrease relative to the control (routes group = 7 minutes/day; incidental group = 15 minutes/day). Reductions were most evident for the incidental group in the first week of intervention, where reported sitting decreased by an average of 21 minutes/day (t = 1.9; p < 0.057). CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, both route and incidental walking increased physical activity in white-collar employees. Our data suggests that workplace walking, particularly through incidental movement, also has the potential to decrease employee sitting times, but there is a need for on-going research using concurrent and objective measures of sitting, standing and walking.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We determined the prevalence by age and sex and associated factors of overweight and obesity in French adolescents. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 2385 adolescents aged 11-18 y (1213 boys and 1172 girls) from middle and high schools in the Aquitaine region (southwest France) in 2004-2005. Weight and height were measured, and adolescents filled in a questionnaire about their characteristics and those of their parents. Overweight and obesity were defined according to the age- and sex-specific body mass index cutoff points of the International Obesity Task force. RESULTS: Prevalence of overweight (obesity included) was greater in boys and younger children. The odds ratio (OR) for an adolescent being overweight increased with parents' being overweight (at least one parent overweight, OR 1.97, 1.48-2.62, P<0.0001), low paternal socioeconomic status (OR 1.78, 1.22-2.60, P<0.01) and sedentary behavior (22 h/wk, OR 1.33, 1.02-1.74, P<0.05), and decreased with physical activity of parents (at least one parent active, OR 0.67, 0.51-0.89, P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that parental overweight and low socioeconomic status and adolescents' sedentary behavior are strong risk factors for adolescent overweight and obesity, and that parents active lifestyle is associated with a lower risk of overweight in their adolescents.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the association between sedentary behavior and obesity among 12-year-old children, while adjusting for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and other potential confounding variables. Cross-sectional analyses were carried out with data from 5,434 children who participated in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Fat mass was derived using dual-energy X-ray emission absorptiometry, and height and weight measurements were used to calculate BMI (kg/m(2)). The children wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The cut points for sedentary behavior and MVPA were <or=199 and >or=3,600 counts per minute (cpm), respectively. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for potential confounders of physical activity that included gender, social factors, early life factors, and maturation. The minimally adjusted association between sedentary behavior and obesity was positive, OR = 1.18 (1.08, 1.28). After adjusting for the series of potential confounders of physical activity the positive association remained, OR = 1.32 (1.14, 1.53). The crude association between 15 min of MVPA per day and obesity was negative, OR = 0.54 (0.48, 0.62). When 15 min of MVPA per day was additionally controlled for in the models, the positive associations between sedentary behavior and obesity were negated. Sedentary behavior was positively associated with obesity in the 12-year-old children, but this association was not independent of MVPA; low levels of MVPA among the sedentary children increased the odds of obesity. These findings support the importance of specifically engaging in MVPA during childhood to reduce the prevalence of obesity.},

Cross-sectional baseline data were compared for community dwelling, healthy African American (N = 262) and Hispanic or Latina women (N = 148) who participated in HIP. Physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) long form, the Check And Line Questionnaire (CALQ) log and accelerometry. Dietary habits were measured using NCI 24-h recall screeners, vegetable and fruit (VF) logs and the NCI Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). Differences in physical activity and dietary habits were assessed using simultaneous 2 (ethnicity) × 3 (weight status) ANCOVAs adjusted for age and socioeconomic status. Women (M age = 44.4 ± 10.9 years) were obese (M = 34.0 ± 9.7 kg/m(2)), did not meet physical activity guidelines as measured by accelerometry (M = 19.4 ± 19.1 min MVPA/day) and ate few VF (M = 2.8 ± 2.7 servings/day). DHQ variables differed by weight status. IPAQ was associated with CALQ, and CALQ with accelerometry (P < .05). IPAQ was not associated with accelerometry. Regardless of ethnicity, normal weight women did more physical activity, reported more VF consumption, and consumed more fat calories than overweight and obese women (Ps < .05). African American women did more MVPA than Hispanic or Latino women (P < .001). Relationships between behaviors and weight status suggest accelerometry and DHQ are preferable, regardless of ethnicity; and studies may capture different domains of physical activity and dietary habits depending on measure used.},

@article{Honas2008,
abstract = {Physical activity is frequently a component of interventions designed to diminish weight gain in children. It is essential to determine whether the energy expenditure (EE) elicited by these interventions is sufficient to reduce the rate of weight gain. PURPOSE: To quantify the EE of the Physical Activity across the Curriculum (PAAC) intervention. This intervention involved two 10-min physically active academic lessons per day, taught by classroom teachers. METHODS: We assessed EE of PAAC in 19 males and 19 females using both an indirect calorimeter (IC) (COSMED K4b(2)) and an accelerometer (ActiGraph) (AC). Independent t-tests were used to evaluate gender differences. Dependent t-tests were used to examine the difference between EE assessed by IC and AC. The agreement between EE measured by IC and estimated by AC was evaluated using a Bland-Altman plot. A Pearson correlation between EE measured by IC and estimated by AC was calculated. RESULTS: There were no significant gender differences for age, BMI, or EE; therefore, analyses by gender were not performed. The mean EE measured by IC was 3.1 +/- 1.0 kcal x min(-1) (3.4 METs). Mean EE estimated by AC (1.8 +/- 0.9 kcal x min(-1)) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than EE measured by IC (mean underestimation = 1.3 kcal x min(-1)). The Bland-Altman plot suggested increased underestimation with increased levels of EE. The 95{\%} limits of agreement were large (-2.8 to +0.3 kcal x min(-1)). The correlation between EE measured by IC and estimated by AC was r = 0.68 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: PAAC elicited a level of EE that may prevent excessive weight gain in children. AC significantly underestimated the EE of PAAC lessons and may not provide useful EE estimates in this context.},

@article{Butryn2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to investigate the characteristics associated with frequent self-weighing and the relationship between self-weighing and weight loss maintenance.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Participants (n = 3003) were members of the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) who had lost >or=30 lbs, kept it off for >or=1 year, and had been administered the self-weighing frequency assessment used for this study at baseline (i.e., entry to the NWCR). Of these, 82{\%} also completed the one-year follow-up assessment.

RESULTS: At baseline, 36.2{\%} of participants reported weighing themselves at least once per day, and more frequent weighing was associated with lower BMI and higher scores on disinhibition and cognitive restraint, although both scores remained within normal ranges. Weight gain at 1-year follow-up was significantly greater for participants whose self-weighing frequency decreased between baseline and one year (4.0 +/- 6.3 kg) compared with those whose frequency increased (1.1 +/- 6.5 kg) or remained the same (1.8 +/- 5.3 kg). Participants who decreased their frequency of self-weighing were more likely to report increases in their percentage of caloric intake from fat and in disinhibition, and decreases in cognitive restraint. However, change in self-weighing frequency was independently associated with weight change.

DISCUSSION: Consistent self-weighing may help individuals maintain their successful weight loss by allowing them to catch weight gains before they escalate and make behavior changes to prevent additional weight gain. While change in self-weighing frequency is a marker for changes in other parameters of weight control, decreasing self-weighing frequency is also independently associated with greater weight gain.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Curbing the epidemic of childhood and adolescent obesity requires impacting multiple behaviors. This article examines the interrelationships of physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and limiting television time among elementary, middle, and high school students. METHODS: Nationwide samples of students in grades 4 through 12 (n=4091) completed self-administered questionnaires assessing Transtheoretical Model constructs and behavioral indicators for physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and limiting television time. Analyses were conducted to compare the prevalence of students at-risk for the target behaviors across the age groups and to examine the interrelationships of the target behavior risks. RESULTS: Across the three age groups, physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption declined, while limiting TV time increased. In addition, high school students had the greater number of behavioral risks. Across all three samples, being at-risk for one behavior almost always significantly increased the odds of being at-risk for another behavior. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide further evidence for the need for early promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviors. The relationships among the target behaviors in three samples strongly support a multiple behavior approach for obesity prevention. Transtheoretical Model-based tailored interventions are currently being used to change multiple behaviors without overwhelming students.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital interventions have been effective in improving numerous health outcomes and health behaviors; furthermore, they are increasingly being used in different health care areas, including self-management of long-term conditions, mental health, and health promotion. The full potential of digital interventions is hindered by a lack of user engagement. There is an urgent need to develop effective strategies that can promote users' engagement with digital interventions. One potential method is the use of technology-based reminders or prompts.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of technology-based strategies for promoting engagement with digital interventions.

METHODS: Cochrane Collaboration guidelines on systematic review methodology were followed. The search strategy was executed across 7 electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Databases were searched from inception to September 13, 2013, with no language or publication type restrictions, using three concepts: randomized controlled trials, digital interventions, and engagement. Gray literature and reference lists of included studies were also searched. Titles and abstracts were independently screened by 2 authors, then the full texts of potentially eligible papers were obtained and double-screened. Data from eligible papers were extracted by one author and checked for accuracy by another author. Bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Narrative synthesis was performed on all included studies and, where appropriate, data were pooled using meta-analysis. All findings were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

RESULTS: A total of 14 studies were included in the review with 8774 participants. Of the 14 studies, 9 had sufficient data to be included in the meta-analyses. The meta-analyses suggested that technology-based strategies can potentially promote engagement compared to no strategy for dichotomous outcomes (relative risk [RR] 1.27, 95{\%} CI 1.01-1.60, I(2)=71{\%}), but due to considerable heterogeneity and the small sample sizes in most studies, this result should be treated with caution. No studies reported adverse or economic outcomes. Only one study with a small sample size compared different characteristics; the study found that strategies promoting new digital intervention content and those sent to users shortly after they started using the digital intervention were more likely to engage users.

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, studies reported borderline positive effects of technology-based strategies on engagement compared to no strategy. However, the results have to be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to replicate findings and understand which characteristics of the strategies are effective in promoting engagement and how cost-effective they are.},

The design was a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 16,539 participants, 17 years of age and older, from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). The main outcome measures were serum levels of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, and total carotenoids. Multivariate linear regression was used to model the association of serum carotenoids and country of birth, language of interview, and years in the United States. Adjustments were made for age, sex, years of education, race/ethnicity, body mass index, alcohol use, physical activity, serum cotinine, serum cholesterol, and vitamin/mineral usage. Individuals born in the United States who speak English had the lowest levels of carotenoids, and individuals born in Mexico had the highest levels of carotenoids, with the exception of lycopene. Years of residence in the United States was associated with lower alpha-carotene (4.18 vs 1.51), beta-carotene (20.21 vs 14.87), beta-cryptoxanthin (12.51 vs 8.95), lutein/zeaxanthin (25.15 vs 18.03), and total carotenoids (88.79 vs 75.44). Years residence in the United States was positively associated with higher lycopene levels (26.69 vs 32.03). Acculturation in the United States was associated with lower fruit and vegetable intake, as measured by serum carotenoid levels.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the suitability of N-of-1 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as a means of testing the effectiveness of behavior change techniques based on self-regulation theory (goal setting and self-monitoring) for promoting walking in healthy adult volunteers. Method: A series of N-of-1 RCTs in 10 normal and overweight adults ages 19–67 (M = 36.9 years). We randomly allocated 60 days within each individual to text message-prompted daily goal-setting and/or self-monitoring interventions in accordance with a 2 (step-count goal prompt vs. alternative goal prompt) × 2 (self-monitoring: open vs. blinded Omron-HJ-113-E pedometer) factorial design. Aggregated data were analyzed using random intercept multilevel models. Single cases were analyzed individually. The primary outcome was daily pedometer step counts over 60 days. Results: Single-case analyses showed that 4 participants significantly increased walking: 2 on self-monitoring days and 2 on goal-setting days, compared with control days. Six participants did not benefit from the interventions. In aggregated analyses, mean step counts were higher on goal-setting days (8,499.9 vs. 7,956.3) and on self-monitoring days (8,630.3 vs. 7,825.9). Multilevel analyses showed a significant effect of the self-monitoring condition (p = .01), the goal-setting condition approached significance (p = .08), and there was a small linear increase in walking over time (p = .03). Conclusion: N-of-1 randomized trials are a suitable means to test behavioral interventions in individual participants. },

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the contributions of frequency, consistency, and comprehensiveness of dietary self-monitoring to long-term weight change.

METHODS: Participants included 220 obese women (mean ± SD, age = 59.3 ± 6.1 years; BMI = 36.8 ± 4.9 kg/m(2) ) who achieved a mean weight loss of -10.39 ± 5.28{\%} from baseline during 6 months of behavioral treatment and regained 2.30 ± 7.28{\%} during a 12-month extended-care period. The contributions of cumulative frequency of self-monitoring (total number of food records), consistency across time (number of weeks with ≥3 records), and comprehensiveness of information recorded were examined as predictors of weight regain in a hierarchical linear regression analysis. The mediating role of adherence to daily caloric intake goals was tested using a bootstrapping analysis.

RESULTS: The association between high total frequency of self-monitoring and reduced weight regain was moderated by weekly consistency of self-monitoring, P = 0.004; increased frequency produced beneficial effects on weight change only when coupled with high consistency (>3 days/week). There was no impact of comprehensiveness on weight change, P > 0.05. The favorable effect of high frequency/high consistency self-monitoring on weight change was partially mediated by participants' success in meeting daily caloric intake goals (P < 0.001).

CONCLUSION: The combination of high frequency plus high consistency of dietary self-monitoring improves long-term success in weight management.},

@article{Direito2014a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been a recent proliferation in the development of smartphone applications (apps) aimed at modifying various health behaviours. While interventions that incorporate behaviour change techniques (BCTs) have been associated with greater effectiveness, it is not clear to what extent smartphone apps incorporate such techniques. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of BCTs in physical activity and dietary apps and determine how reliably the taxonomy checklist can be used to identify BCTs in smartphone apps.

METHODS: The top-20 paid and top-20 free physical activity and/or dietary behaviour apps from the New Zealand Apple App Store Health {\&} Fitness category were downloaded to an iPhone. Four independent raters user-tested and coded each app for the presence/absence of BCTs using the taxonomy of behaviour change techniques (26 BCTs in total). The number of BCTs included in the 40 apps was calculated. Krippendorff's alpha was used to evaluate interrater reliability for each of the 26 BCTs.

RESULTS: Apps included an average of 8.1 (range 2-18) techniques, the number being slightly higher for paid (M = 9.7, range 2-18) than free apps (M = 6.6, range 3-14). The most frequently included BCTs were "provide instruction" (83{\%} of the apps), "set graded tasks" (70{\%}), and "prompt self-monitoring" (60{\%}). Techniques such as "teach to use prompts/cues", "agree on behavioural contract", "relapse prevention" and "time management" were not present in the apps reviewed. Interrater reliability coefficients ranged from 0.1 to 0.9 (Mean 0.6, SD = 0.2).

CONCLUSIONS: Presence of BCTs varied by app type and price; however, BCTs associated with increased intervention effectiveness were in general more common in paid apps. The taxonomy checklist can be used by independent raters to reliably identify BCTs in physical activity and dietary behaviour smartphone apps.},

@article{Charansonney2010a,
abstract = {Obesity is a major health challenge facing the modern world. Some evidence points to obesity itself as the main driver of premature mortality. We propose that this view is oversimplified. For example, high levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with lower mortality, even in those who are overweight or obese. To address this issue, we combine epidemiological and physiological evidence in a new paradigm that integrates excess calorie intake, sedentary behavior, and a maladaptive response to stress. Human physiology is optimized to allow large distances to be covered on foot every day in order to find enough food to sustain brain metabolism. Furthermore, when the body is immobilized by an injury, it triggers efficient life-saving metabolic and inflammatory responses. Both these critical adaptations are, however, confounded by a sedentary lifestyle. The implications of these issues for clinical trial design and epidemiologic data analysis are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study examines changes between 2003 and 2007 in obesity and overweight prevalence among U.S. children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age from detailed racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. METHODS: The 2003 (N=46,707) and 2007 (N=44,101) National Survey of Children's Health were used to calculate overweight and obesity prevalence (body mass index [BMI] > or = 85th and > or = 95th percentiles, respectively). Logistic regression was used to model odds of obesity. RESULTS: In 2007, 16.4{\%} of U.S. children were obese and 31.6{\%} were overweight. From 2003 to 2007, obesity prevalence increased by 10{\%} for all U.S. children but increased by 23{\%}-33{\%} for children in low-education, low-income, and higher unemployment households. Obesity prevalence increased markedly among Hispanic children and children from single-mother households. In 2007, Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, and American Indian children had 3.0-3.8 times higher odds of obesity and overweight than Asian children; children from low-income and low-education households had 3.4-4.3 times higher odds of obesity than children from higher socioeconomic households. The magnitude of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity and overweight prevalence increased between 2003 and 2007, with substantial social inequalities persisting even after controlling for behavioral factors. CONCLUSIONS: Social inequalities in obesity and overweight prevalence increased because of more rapid increases in prevalence among children in lower socioeconomic groups.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the presence and duration of reactivity to wearing a pedometer and recording daily step counts in free-living adults.

METHODS: On the first visit to the laboratory, 90 participants (69{\%} were females, age = 26.8 ± 13.0 yr, body mass index = 23.4 ± 4.0 kg·m(-2)), blinded to the study aim, were provided with a sealed pedometer (New Lifestyles NL-800) and informed that it was a "body posture monitor" (covert condition). Participants wore the pedometer throughout waking hours for 1 wk. On their return to the laboratory, stored step counts were recorded, and participants were informed that the device was a pedometer. Participants wore the pedometer unsealed (no restriction on viewing the step count display) for 2 wk, during which they recorded their daily step count in a diary (diary condition). Mean daily step counts recorded during the covert condition and during weeks 1 and 2 of the diary condition were compared using a repeated-measures ANOVA.

RESULTS: There was a significant overall effect of study condition (P < 0.001), with post hoc analyses revealing that mean daily step counts reported during the first week of the diary condition (9898 ± 3002 steps per day) were significantly higher than those reported during the covert condition (8331 ± 3010 steps per day) and during the second week of the diary condition (8226 ± 3170 steps per day, P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Reactivity to wearing unsealed pedometers and step count recording seems to last for 1 wk. In the absence of any intervention material, step counts return to normal levels during the second week of monitoring and therefore represent a more accurate estimate of habitual activity. These findings have important implications to both researchers and practitioners interested in the use of pedometers for physical activity surveillance and promotion.},

@article{Dennison2013a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest from academics and clinicians in harnessing smartphone applications (apps) as a means of delivering behavioral interventions for health. Despite the growing availability of a range of health-related apps on the market, academic research on the development and evaluation of such apps is in the relatively early stages. A few existing studies have explored the views of various populations on using mobile phones for health-related issues and some studies are beginning to report user feedback on specific apps. However, there remains little in depth research on users' (and potential users') experiences and views on a wide range of features and technologies that apps are, or will soon be, capable of. In particular, research on young adults is lacking, which is an unfortunate omission considering that this group comprises of a good number of mobile technology adoptors. OBJECTIVE: The current study sought to explore young adults' perspectives on apps related to health behavior change. It sought their experiences and views of features that might support health behavior change and issues that contribute to interest in and willingness to use such apps. METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with 19 students and staff at a University in the United Kingdom. Participants included 13 females and 6 males with a mean age of 23.79 (SD 7.89). The focus group discussions centred on participants' experiences of using smartphone apps to support a healthy lifestyle, and their interest in and feelings about features and capabilities of such apps. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Study findings suggested that young, currently healthy adults have some interest in apps that attempt to support health-related behavior change. Accuracy and legitimacy, security, effort required, and immediate effects on mood emerged as important influences on app usage. The ability to record and track behavior and goals and the ability to acquire advice and information "on the go" were valued. Context-sensing capabilities and social media features tended to be considered unnecessary and off-putting. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided insight into the opportunities and challenges involved in delivering health-related behavioral interventions through smartphone apps. The findings suggested a number of valued features and characteristics that app developers may wish to consider when creating health behavior apps. Findings also highlighted several major challenges that appeared to need further consideration and research to ensure the development of effective and well-accepted behavior change apps.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the efficacy of adding a technology-based program to an in-person, behavioral weight loss intervention.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Fifty-seven subjects (BMI=33.1+/-2.8 kg/m2; age=41.3+/-8.7 years) participated in a 12-week intervention with random assignment to Standard In-Person Behavioral Weight Control Program (SBWP) or Intermittent or Continuous Technology-Based Program (INT-TECH, CON-TECH). SBWP subjects received seven individualized weight loss sessions encouraging dietary and exercise modifications. INT-TECH and CON-TECH subjects received all SBWP components; additionally, these groups used a SenseWear Pro Armband (BodyMedia, Inc.) to monitor energy expenditure and an Internet-based program to monitor eating behaviors. These features were used by INT-TECH subjects during weeks 1, 5, and 9 and CON-TECH subjects weekly throughout the intervention.

RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analysis revealed weight loss of 4.1+/-2.8 kg, 3.4+/-3.4 kg, and 6.2+/-4.0 kg, for SBWP, INT-TECH, and CON-TECH groups, respectively (CON-TECH>INT-TECH, p<or=0.05).

DISCUSSION: These results indicate that the technology-based program needs to be used continuously throughout the intervention period to significantly impact weight loss. Future studies should examine the long-term and independent effect of this technology on weight loss, and for whom this intervention format is most effective.},

abstract = {The recent development of global positioning system (GPS) receivers with integrated heart rate (HR) monitoring has provided a new method for estimating the energy expenditure associated with children's movement. The purpose of this feasibility study was to trial a combination of GPS surveillance and HR monitoring in 39 primary-aged children from New Zealand. Spatial location and HR data were recorded during a school lunch break using an integrated GPS/HR receiver (1Hz). Children averaged a total distance of 1.10+/-0.56km at speeds ranging from 0 to 18.6kmh(-1). Activity patterns were characterised by short bursts of moderate to high speeds followed by longer periods of slow speeds. In addition, boys averaged higher speeds than girls (1.77+/-0.62kmh(-1) and 1.36+/-0.50kmh(-1), respectively; p=0.003). The percentage of time spent at 0kmh(-1) (stationary) ranged from 0.1{\%} to 21.3{\%} with a mean of 6.4+/-4.6{\%}. These data suggest that while children were relatively active during the lunch period, they spent a substantial portion of time engaged in slow or stationary physical activities. Furthermore, associations between HR, average speed, and stationary time demonstrated that children who moved at faster speeds expended more energy than those who moved at slower speeds. We conclude that the combined approach of GPS and HR monitoring is a promising new method for investigating children's play-related energy expenditure. There is also scope to integrate GPS data with geographic information systems to examine where children play and accumulate physical activity.},

abstract = {Aim of this study was to investigate the sedentary patterns of school-aged active children admitted to a summer sport school. One hundred-twelve children aged 9-11 years were interviewed through a questionnaire about sedentary behaviours and nutrition habits. Seventy-one per cent of children reported they watch TV seven days a week, girls less than boys (84 +/- 45 minutes vs. 110 +/- 75 minutes) (t = 2.056; p = 0.042). The habit of TV viewing during meals was widespread (38{\%} breakfast, 31{\%} lunch, 62{\%} dinner, 18{\%} every meal). The prevalence of overweight or obesity (58.5{\%}) was significantly higher among boys watching TV at dinner compared to the boys viewing TV only in the afternoon (35{\%}) (chi2 = 4.976; p = 0.026). Fifty-seven per cent of children (65{\%} boys) were accustomed to nibble snacks during TV viewing, and this habit was widespread in overweight or obese boys (chi2 = 4.546; p = 0.033). The dietary patterns of children watching TV include more snack foods and fewer fruits than the dietary patterns of the same children exercising (chi2 = 4.199 p = 0.040). Also in active children the habit to watch television is widespread and, in spite of the tendency to physical activity, 46{\%} of them were overweight or obese; in fact the time spent looking at a TV may be associated to overweight/obesity and this relationship could be explained by the amount of high-density foods consumption during inactivity.

abstract = {Our current health research enterprise is painstakingly slow and cumbersome, and its results seldom translate into practice. The slow pace of health research contributes to findings that are less relevant and potentially even obsolete. To produce more rapid, responsive, and relevant research, we propose approaches that increase relevance via greater stakeholder involvement, speed research via innovative designs, streamline review processes, and create and/or better leverage research infrastructure. Broad stakeholder input integrated throughout the research process can both increase relevance and facilitate study procedures. More flexible and rapid research designs should be considered before defaulting to the traditional two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), but even traditional RCTs can be designed for more rapid findings. Review processes for grant applications, IRB protocols, and manuscript submissions can be better streamlined to minimize delays. Research infrastructures such as rapid learning systems and other health information technologies can be leveraged to rapidly evaluate new and existing treatments, and alleviate the extensive recruitment delays common in traditional research. These and other approaches are feasible but require a culture shift among the research community to value not only methodological rigor, but also the pace and relevance of research.},

The design was a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 16,539 participants, 17 years of age and older, from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). The main outcome measures were serum levels of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, and total carotenoids. Multivariate linear regression was used to model the association of serum carotenoids and country of birth, language of interview, and years in the United States. Adjustments were made for age, sex, years of education, race/ethnicity, body mass index, alcohol use, physical activity, serum cotinine, serum cholesterol, and vitamin/mineral usage. Individuals born in the United States who speak English had the lowest levels of carotenoids, and individuals born in Mexico had the highest levels of carotenoids, with the exception of lycopene. Years of residence in the United States was associated with lower alpha-carotene (4.18 vs 1.51), beta-carotene (20.21 vs 14.87), beta-cryptoxanthin (12.51 vs 8.95), lutein/zeaxanthin (25.15 vs 18.03), and total carotenoids (88.79 vs 75.44). Years residence in the United States was positively associated with higher lycopene levels (26.69 vs 32.03). Acculturation in the United States was associated with lower fruit and vegetable intake, as measured by serum carotenoid levels.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Behavior is influenced by individual-level attributes as well as by the conditions under which people live. Altering policies, practices, and the conditions of life can directly and indirectly influence individual behavior. This paper builds on existing ecological theories of health behavior by specifying structural mechanisms by which population-level factors effect change in individual health behaviors. METHODS: This paper moves ecological theory from model building to a pragmatic characterization of structural interventions. We examined social and environmental factors beyond individual control and mechanisms as to how they influence behavior. RESULTS: Four categories of structural factors are identified: (1) availability of protective or harmful consumer products, (2) physical structures (or physical characteristics of products), (3) social structures and policies, and (4) media and cultural messages. The first three can directly influence individuals through facilitating or constraining behavior. The fourth, media, operates by changing individual-level attitudes, beliefs, and cognitions, as well as group norms. CONCLUSION: Interventions that target the four identified structural factors are a means to provide conditions that not only reduce high-risk behavior but also prevent the adoption of high-risk behaviors. Structural interventions are important and underutilized approaches for improving our nation's health.},

Workers (N = 185) wore a pedometer for 7 days and recorded the number of steps taken and time spent sitting each day. Average time spent sitting on weekdays was 9.4 (SD = 2.40) hr, with about half spent sitting at work. Despite this, the average steps taken each day (M = 8,873, SD = 2,757) was higher on weekdays than on weekend days. There was a clear inverse relationship between sitting time at work and number of steps taken on weekdays, r = -.34, p < .001); those in the highest tertile for sitting time reported about 3,000 fewer daily steps. Workers in managerial and professional occupations reported more time sitting at work (M = 6.2 hr per day) and lower weekday step counts (M = 7,883, N = 43) than technical (M = 3.3 hr sitting at work and 10,731 weekday steps, N = 33) and blue collar workers (M = 1.6 hours sitting and 11,784 steps, N = 11). The findings suggest those whose daily work involves long hours of sitting should be the focus of efforts to promote physical activity both within and outside the workplace.},

These applications are being developed in a variety of domains, but rigorous research is needed to examine the potential, as well as the challenges, of utilizing mobile technologies to improve health outcomes. Currently, evidence is sparse for the efficacy of mHealth. Although these technologies may be appealing and seemingly innocuous, research is needed to assess when, where, and for whom mHealth devices, apps, and systems are efficacious. In order to outline an approach to evidence generation in the field of mHealth that would ensure research is conducted on a rigorous empirical and theoretic foundation, on August 16, 2011, researchers gathered for the mHealth Evidence Workshop at NIH. The current paper presents the results of the workshop. Although the discussions at the meeting were cross-cutting, the areas covered can be categorized broadly into three areas: (1) evaluating assessments; (2) evaluating interventions; and (3) reshaping evidence generation using mHealth. This paper brings these concepts together to describe current evaluation standards, discuss future possibilities, and set a grand goal for the emerging field of mHealth research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, childhood obesity has been recognized as an increasing health problem worldwide. It is a predictor of obesity during adulthood, which is strongly linked to chronic lifestyle diseases. PURPOSE: This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based programs in the prevention and management of childhood obesity. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken for RCTs and clinical controlled trials on school-based interventions that addressed childhood obesity, published between 1995 and 2007. The papers included for the meta-analysis were those in which ORs or standardized mean differences and their 95{\%} CIs were reported or could be calculated from available data. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed that the odds of participants' being overweight and obese in the school-based intervention programs compared with the control arm were significantly protective in the short term (OR=0.74, 95{\%} CI=0.60, 0.92). Interventions that were conducted for more than 1 year had a higher OR of decreasing the prevalence of obesity. However, intervention programs were not effective in decreasing BMI compared with control treatments, with a weighted mean difference of -0.62 (95{\%} CI=-1.39, 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that there was convincing evidence that school-based interventions are effective, at least short-term, in reducing the prevalence of childhood obesity. Longer-running programs were more effective than shorter programs.},

abstract = {Pedometers are simple and inexpensive body-worn motion sensors that are readily being used by researchers and practitioners to assess and motivate physical activity behaviours. Pedometer-determined physical activity indices are needed to guide their efforts. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to review the rationale and evidence for general pedometer-based indices for research and practice purposes. Specifically, we evaluate popular recommendations for steps/day and attempt to translate existing physical activity guidelines into steps/day equivalents. Also, we appraise the fragmented evidence currently available from associations derived from cross-sectional studies and a limited number of interventions that have documented improvements (primarily in body composition and/or blood pressure) with increased steps/day.A value of 10000 steps/day is gaining popularity with the media and in practice and can be traced to Japanese walking clubs and a business slogan 30+ years ago. 10000 steps/day appears to be a reasonable estimate of daily activity for apparently healthy adults and studies are emerging documenting the health benefits of attaining similar levels. Preliminary evidence suggests that a goal of 10000 steps/day may not be sustainable for some groups, including older adults and those living with chronic diseases. Another concern about using 10000 steps/day as a universal step goal is that it is probably too low for children, an important target population in the war against obesity. Other approaches to pedometer-determined physical activity recommendations that are showing promise of health benefit and individual sustainability have been based on incremental improvements relative to baseline values. Based on currently available evidence, we propose the following preliminary indices be used to classify pedometer-determined physical activity in healthy adults: (i). <5000 steps/day may be used as a 'sedentary lifestyle index'; (ii). 5000-7499 steps/day is typical of daily activity excluding sports/exercise and might be considered 'low active'; (iii). 7500-9999 likely includes some volitional activities (and/or elevated occupational activity demands) and might be considered 'somewhat active'; and (iv). >or=10000 steps/day indicates the point that should be used to classify individuals as 'active'. Individuals who take >12500 steps/day are likely to be classified as 'highly active'.},

abstract = {Movement sensing using accelerometers is commonly used for the measurement of physical activity (PA) and estimating energy expenditure (EE) under free-living conditions. The major limitation of this approach is lack of accuracy and precision in estimating EE, especially in low-intensity activities. Thus the objective of this study was to investigate benefits of a distributed lag spline (DLS) modeling approach for the prediction of total daily EE (TEE) and EE in sedentary (1.0-1.5 metabolic equivalents; MET), light (1.5-3.0 MET), and moderate/vigorous (> or = 3.0 MET) intensity activities in 10- to 17-year-old youth (n = 76). We also explored feasibility of the DLS modeling approach to predict physical activity EE (PAEE) and METs. Movement was measured by Actigraph accelerometers placed on the hip, wrist, and ankle. With whole-room indirect calorimeter as the reference standard, prediction models (Hip, Wrist, Ankle, Hip+Wrist, Hip+Wrist+Ankle) for TEE, PAEE, and MET were developed and validated using the fivefold cross-validation method. The TEE predictions by these DLS models were not significantly different from the room calorimeter measurements (all P > 0.05). The Hip+Wrist+Ankle predicted TEE better than other models and reduced prediction errors in moderate/vigorous PA for TEE, MET, and PAEE (all P < 0.001). The Hip+Wrist reduced prediction errors for the PAEE and MET at sedentary PA (P = 0.020 and 0.021) compared with the Hip. Models that included Wrist correctly classified time spent at light PA better than other models. The means and standard deviations of the prediction errors for the Hip+Wrist+Ankle and Hip were 0.4 +/- 144.0 and 1.5 +/- 164.7 kcal for the TEE, 0.0 +/- 84.2 and 1.3 +/- 104.7 kcal for the PAEE, and -1.1 +/- 97.6 and -0.1 +/- 108.6 MET min for the MET models. We conclude that the DLS approach for accelerometer data improves detailed EE prediction in youth.},

MapMyFitness is a suite of interactive tools for individuals to track their workouts online or using global positioning system in their phones or other wireless trackers. This method article discusses the use of physical activity data tracked using MapMyFitness to examine patterns over space and time. An overview of MapMyFitness, including data tracked, user information, and geographic scope, is explored. We illustrate the utility of MapMyFitness data using tracked physical activity by users in Winston-Salem, NC, USA between 2006 and 2013. Types of physical activities tracked are described, as well as the percent of activities occurring in parks. Strengths of MapMyFitness data include objective data collection, low participant burden, extensive geographic scale, and longitudinal series. Limitations include generalizability, behavioral change as the result of technology use, and potential ethical considerations. MapMyFitness is a powerful tool to investigate patterns of physical activity across large geographic and temporal scales.},

@article{Gortmaker1999a,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a school-based health behavior intervention known as Planet Health on obesity among boys and girls in grades 6 to 8. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled field trial with 5 intervention and 5 control schools. Outcomes were assessed using preintervention (fall 1995) and follow-up measures (spring 1997), including prevalence, incidence, and remission of obesity. PARTICIPANTS: A group of 1295 ethnically diverse grade 6 and 7 students from public schools in 4 Massachusetts communities. INTERVENTION: Students participated in a school-based interdisciplinary intervention over 2 school years. Planet Health sessions were included within existing curricula using classroom teachers in 4 major subjects and physical education. Sessions focused on decreasing television viewing, decreasing consumption of high-fat foods, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, and increasing moderate and vigorous physical activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Obesity was defined as a composite indicator based on both a body mass index and a triceps skinfold value greater than or equal to age- and sex-specific 85th percentiles. Because schools were randomized, rather than students, the generalized estimating equation method was used to adjust for individual-level covariates under cluster randomization. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity among girls in intervention schools was reduced compared with controls, controlling for baseline obesity (odds ratio, 0.47; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.24-0.93; P = .03), with no differences found among boys. There was greater remission of obesity among intervention girls vs. control girls (odds ratio, 2.16; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.07-4.35; P = .04). The intervention reduced television hours among both girls and boys, and increased fruit and vegetable consumption and resulted in a smaller increment in total energy intake among girls. Reductions in television viewing predicted obesity change and mediated the intervention effect. Among girls, each hour of reduction in television viewing predicted reduced obesity prevalence (odds ratio, 0.85; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.75-0.97; P = .02). CONCLUSION: Planet Health decreased obesity among female students, indicating a promising school-based approach to reducing obesity among youth.},

@article{Tudor-Locke2009a,
abstract = {The results of two recent independent meta-analyses focused on pedometer-based programmes conclude that they work; that is, they are effective. Specifically, physical activity increases while blood pressure and weight decrease as a result of participating in a pedometer-based intervention. An improved understanding of the unique measurement and motivational properties of pedometers as behaviour-change tools will assist researchers and practitioners to maximize benefits. In an effort to begin to outline why pedometers work, for whom, and under what conditions, the purpose of this current opinion article is to explore the published literature (drawing heavily from those studies previously identified in published meta-analyses and our own work in this area) to identify factors related to using pedometers to increase physical activity. In particular it is important to: (i) gain a better understanding of the activity-promoting characteristics of pedometers; (ii) determine effective elements of pedometer-based programming; and (iii) identify participants who engage in, and benefit most from, such programming. Pedometers are most sensitive to walking behaviours, which is consistent with public health and clinical approaches to increasing physical activity. Specifically, they offer an affordable and accessible technology that is simplistic in output, low-literacy friendly, and immediately understandable to end-users. Support materials are becoming readily available for researchers and practitioners in terms of expected (normative or benchmark) values, patterns of change, indices to aid screening and interpretation, and measurement protocols. Pedometer-based programme theory is now being articulated and tested, and the critical elements necessary to shape a successful programme are becoming more clearly defined. More research is needed, however, to compare the effectiveness of self-selected individualized goals with tailored goals (based on a specified baseline characteristic, for example), standardized goals (e.g. percentage-based increments) and pre-set uniformly administered goals (i.e. a volume total of 10 000 steps/day or an incremental total of 2000 extra steps/day for everyone). Since most studies of pedometer-based programmes have been of relatively short duration, it is unknown to what extent observed changes are sustainable or whether it is possible to continue to accrue benefits over long-term adherence. Peer delivery of treatment has the potential for enabling wider and less costly dissemination, although this has not been directly evaluated. In addition, the majority of pedometer-based programme participants to date have been women, suggesting that more research is needed on men and how they react to this form of physical activity intervention. Increases in steps/day have been negatively correlated with baseline values, indicating that those with lower baseline steps/day stand to make the greatest relative incremental increases in physical activity behaviour. A clearly articulated programme theory is lacking in most interventions. A clearer understanding is needed of what programme features, including the nature of goal-setting, are necessary for optimal participant success. Additionally, we need a better profile of the participant who benefits most, and/or requires additional or alternative strategies to succeed in their personal behaviour-change attempts. Continued efforts to refine answers regarding what works well for whom under what conditions will foster evidence-based applications of pedometer-based programmes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This review seeks to examine the effectiveness of school-based programs for reducing childhood overweight or obesity. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A systematic review of the research literature published since 1990 was conducted to identify experimental or quasi-experimental school-based curricular or environmental preventive interventions, with evaluation>or=6 months after baseline, which reported outcomes in terms of a measure of overweight. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified, including one involving a nutrition-only program, two physical activity promotion interventions and eleven studies combining nutrition and physical activity components. Most studies (n=10) offered weak (grade 2) quality evidence. One study offered strong (grade 4) evidence reducing the odds ratio for overweight in girls only, while four grade 2 studies reported significant improvements in BMI or at-risk-for overweight or overweight prevalence in boys, girls, or both. Twelve studies reported significant improvement in at least one measure of dietary intake, physical activity, and/or sedentary behavior. DISCUSSION: Our ability to draw strong conclusions as to the efficacy of school-based obesity prevention programs is limited by the small number of published studies and by methodological concerns. Qualitative analysis suggests programs grounded in social learning may be more appropriate for girls, while structural and environmental interventions enabling physical activity may be more effective for boys. High-quality evaluation protocols should be considered essential components of future programs.},

The evidence on the relationship of participation of demographic and health characteristic is conflicting. The study presented here prospectively examined the relationship of personnel data and self-reported smoking, exercise, and dietary behavior to participation in the initial phase of a new health-promotion program. Compared with the total population, participants tended to be older and more educated, to be foreign-born and of Eastern ethnic origin, and to have more children. The participant population also tended to include more women, married individuals, and noncommissioned officers. A low smoking prevalence (17{\%} of the participants), a high mean exercise rate (four times per week), and low weekly mean egg consumption (2.7) were observed among the program participants. These results indicate that this program preferentially enrolled people who already were committed to healthy lifestyles, and did not reach all segments of the work force equally.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differences in availability of recreational resources may contribute to racial and socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in physical activity. Variations in the location and density of recreational resources were examined by SES and racial composition of neighborhoods. METHODS: Densities of resources available in recreational facilities and parks were estimated for census tracts between April 2003 and June 2004 in North Carolina, New York, and Maryland using kernel estimation. The probability of not having a facility or park was modeled by tract racial composition and SES, adjusting for population and area, using binomial regression in 2006. Mean densities of tract resources were modeled by SES and racial composition using linear regression. RESULTS: Minority neighborhoods were significantly more likely than white neighborhoods not to have recreational facilities (relative probability [RP]=3.27 [95{\%} CI=2.11-5.07] and 8.60 [95{\%} CI=4.48-16.51], for black and Hispanic neighborhoods, respectively). Low-income neighborhoods were 4.5 times more likely to not have facilities than high-income areas (95{\%} CI=2.87-7.12). Parks were more equitably distributed. Most resources located in recreational facilities required a fee and were less dense in minority and low-income areas. Those located inside parks were usually free to use, sports-related, and denser in poor and minority neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Recreational facilities and the resources they offer are not equitably distributed. The presence of parks in poor and minority areas suggest that improving the types and quality of resources in parks could be an important strategy to increase physical activity and reduce racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: To characterize accelerometer-derived estimates of physical inactivity collected over 5 consecutive weeks in middle-aged women. METHODS:: Data were obtained from 63 participants (95.5{\%}) enrolled in the Evaluation of Physical Activity Measures in Middle-Aged Women (PAW) Study. Inactive time (min/d) was estimated as the sum of activity counts <100 and inactive-to-active transitions were defined as an interruption in which a period of inactivity was immediately followed by a minute or more above 100 counts. Repeated measures ANOVA using PROC MIXED (SAS/STAT software, v. 9.2) were used to describe hourly, daily, and weekly variation in estimates of physical inactivity. RESULTS:: Participants were 52.7 ± 5.5 years, 85.7{\%} non-Hispanic white, 63.5{\%} post-menopausal, with a BMI of 26.7 ± 5.1 kg/m. Inactive time graduallyincreased as the day continued, particularly on weekend days. When compared to weekdays, average inactive time was lower on Saturday and Sunday (all p<.01 except for Saturday vs. Monday p<.10); Saturdays were not significantly different from Sundays. Breaks in inactive time were significantly lower on Sunday when compared to weekdays and Saturday (all p<.05) and fewer breaks were noted on Saturday when compared to Wednesday and Friday (both p<.01). After adjustment for total wear time or inactive time, most day-to-day differences were attenuated. Week-by-week differences in physical inactivity estimates were also not statistically significant. CONCLUSION:: Results of this study suggest that inactive time increases as the day continues and that daily physical inactivity estimates are more stable after 1) adjustment for wear time or 2) when averaged over the week. Researchers should carefully consider the intended application of physical inactivity estimates prior to data collection and processing, analysis, and final data reporting.},

abstract = {Despite significant gains by pediatric collaborative improvement networks, the overall US system of chronic illness care does not work well. A new paradigm is needed: a Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N). A C3N is a network-based production system that harnesses the collective intelligence of patients, clinicians, and researchers and distributes the production of knowledge, information, and know-how over large groups of people, dramatically accelerating the discovery process. A C3N is a platform of "operating systems" on which interconnected processes and interventions are designed, tested, and implemented. The social operating system is facilitated by community building, engaging all stakeholders and their expertise, and providing multiple ways to participate. Standard progress measures and a robust information technology infrastructure enable the technical operating system to reduce unwanted variation and adopt advances more rapidly. A structured approach to innovation design provides a scientific operating system or "laboratory" for what works and how to make it work. Data support testing and research on multiple levels: comparative effectiveness research for populations, evaluating care delivery processes at the care center level, and N-of-1 trials and other methods to select the best treatment of individual patient circumstances. Methods to reduce transactional costs to participate include a Federated IRB Model in which centers rely on a protocol approved at 1 central institutional review board and a "commons framework" for organizational copyright and intellectual property concerns. A fully realized C3N represents a discontinuous leap to a self-developing learning health system capable of producing a qualitatively different approach to improving health.},

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We developed a cut-off for accelerometry output (validation study) in 30 healthy 3 to 4 year olds, which provided highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of sedentary behavior relative to a criterion method of measurement, direct observation using the children's physical activity form. We then cross-validated the cut-off in an independent sample of healthy 3 to 4 year olds (n = 52). RESULTS: In the validation study, optimal sensitivity and specificity for the detection of sedentary behavior were obtained at an accelerometry output cut-off of <1100 counts/min. In the cross-validation, sensitivity was 83{\%}: 438/528 inactive minutes were correctly classified. Specificity was 82{\%}: 1251/1526 noninactive minutes were correctly classified using this cut-off. DISCUSSION: Sedentary behavior can be quantified objectively in young children using accelerometry. This new technique could be considered for a wide variety of applications in the etiology, prevention, and treatment of childhood obesity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was conducted to determine the effect of physical education class enrollment and physical activity on academic achievement in middle school children. METHODS: Participants were 214 sixth-grade students randomly assigned to physical education during either first or second semesters. Moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (number of 30-min time blocks) outside of school was assessed using the 3-d physical activity recall (3DPAR). The 3DPAR time blocks were converted to ordinal data with scores of 1 (no activity), 2 (some activity), or 3 (activity meeting Healthy People 2010 guidelines). Academic achievement was assessed using grades from four core academic classes and standardized test scores (Terra Nova percentiles). RESULTS: Grades were similar regardless of whether students were enrolled in physical education during first or second semesters. Physical education classes averaged only 19 min of MVPA. Students who either performed some or met Healthy People 2010 guidelines for vigorous activity had significantly higher grades (P < 0.05) than students who performed no vigorous activity in both semesters. Moderate physical activity did not affect grades. Standardized test scores were not significantly related to physical education class enrollment or physical activity levels. CONCLUSION: Although academic achievement was not significantly related to physical education enrollment, higher grades were associated with vigorous physical activity, particularly activity meeting recommended Healthy People 2010 levels.},

This work, however, remain largely siloed within the two communities. We begin to address this silo problem by attempting to build a bridge between the two disciplines at the level of behavioral theory. Specifically, we define core theoretical terms to create shared understanding about what theory is, discuss ways in which behavioral theory can be used to inform research on behavior change technologies, identify shortcomings in current behavioral theories, and outline ways in which HCI researchers can not only interpret and utilize behavioral science theories but also contribute to improving them.

Through participation in US-based QS events and watching online QS presentations from around the globe, we identify a function of ambiguous valuation for supporting sharing communities. Drawing on Stark's (2011) theory of heterarchy, we argue that the social and technical platforms supporting sharing within the QS community allow for multiple, sometimes conflicting, sets of community and commercial values. Community cohesion benefits from ambiguity over which values set is most important to QS members. Ambiguity is promoted by sharing practices through at least two means, the narrative structure of members' presentations, and what counts as tracking. By encouraging members to adhere to a three-question outline, the community ensures that multiple values are always present. Thus, it becomes a question of which valu...},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations between objectively assessed intensity levels of physical activity and academic achievement and test whether cardiovascular fitness mediates the association between physical activity and academic achievement. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional data were gathered in Swedish 9th-grade students (n = 232; mean age = 16 years; 52{\%} girls). School grades, pubertal phase, skinfold thickness, cardiovascular fitness, and physical activity were measured objectively. Mother's education, family structure, and parental monitoring were self-reported. Data were analyzed with linear regression analyses. RESULTS: After controlling for confounding factors, academic achievement was associated with vigorous physical activity in girls (beta = .30, P < .01; explained variance of the model 26{\%}), which remained after inclusion of fitness (beta = .23, P < .05; explained variance 29{\%}). The association was not mediated by fitness. In boys, academic achievement was associated with pubertal phase (beta = .25, P < .05). After inclusion of fitness, it was only associated with fitness (beta = .25, P < .05; explained variance of the model 30{\%}). CONCLUSION: In girls, academic achievement was associated with vigorous physical activity and not mediated by fitness, whereas in boys only fitness was associated with academic achievement. Further studies are necessary to investigate the potential longitudinal effect of vigorous physical activity on academic achievement, the role of fitness herein and the implications of these findings for schools.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In order to quantify the effects of physical activity such as walking on chronic disease, accurate measurement of physical activity is needed. The objective of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of a new activity monitor, the Fitbit One, in a population of healthy adults.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.

METHODS: Thirty healthy adults ambulated at 5 different speeds (0.90, 1.12, 1.33, 1.54, 1.78 m/s) on a treadmill while wearing three Fitbit One activity monitors (two on the hips and one in the pocket). The order of each speed condition was randomized. Fitbit One step count output was compared to observer counts and distance output was compared to the calibrated treadmill output. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, concordance correlation coefficients, and Bland and Altman plots were used to assess validity and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess reliability.

RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between Fitbit One step count outputs and observer counts, and concordance was substantial (0.97-1.00). Inter-device reliability of the step count was high for all walking speeds (ICC ≥ 0.95). Percent relative error was less than 1.3{\%}. The distance output of the Fitbit One activity monitors was significantly different from the criterion values for each monitor at all speeds (P<0.001) and exhibited poor concordance (0.0-0.05). Inter-device reliability was excellent for all treadmill speeds (ICC ≥ 0.90). Percent relative error was high (up to 39.6{\%}).

CONCLUSIONS: The Fitbit One activity monitors are valid and reliable devices for measuring step counts in healthy young adults. The distance output of the monitors is inaccurate and should be noted with caution.},

The aims of the study were to examine whether sedentary work is associated with colorectal cancer and to determine whether the association differs by subsite. A total of 918 cases and 1,021 controls participated in a population-based case-control study of colorectal cancer in Western Australia in 2005-2007. Data were collected on lifestyle, physical activity, and lifetime job history. The estimated effects of sedentary work on the risk of cancers of the proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum were analyzed by using multinomial logistic regression. Compared with participants who did not spend any time in sedentary work, participants who spent 10 or more years in sedentary work had almost twice the risk of distal colon cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1.94, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.28, 2.93) and a 44{\%} increased risk of rectal cancer (adjusted odds ratio = 1.44, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.96, 2.18). This association was independent of recreational physical activity and was seen even among the most recreationally active participants. Sedentary work was not associated with the risk of proximal colon cancer. These results suggest that long-term sedentary work may increase the risk of distal colon cancer and rectal cancer.},

Persistent use of culture-driven acculturation models decenters social determinants of health as key factors in health disparities and diminishes the effectiveness of cultural competency practice. Social and economic determinants are more important predictors than is culture in understanding health care disparities.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newly arrived Hispanic immigrants are generally healthier than the U.S.-born population, but this distinction tends to diminish over time as immigrants adapt to a new and different sociocultural environment. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether length of residence in the United States was associated with obesity (body mass index [BMI]>30 kg/m(2)) among Hispanic immigrants. METHODS: Data for 2420 foreign-born Hispanic adults aged > or =18 years were obtained from the 1998 National Health Interview Survey. RESULTS: The prevalence of obesity among those with 0 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and > or =15 years of residence in the United States was 9.4{\%}, 14.5{\%}, 21.0{\%}, and 24.2{\%}, respectively. A logistic regression model adjusted for smoking, physical inactivity, self-assessed health, chronic conditions, functional limitations, nonspecific psychological distress, several sociodemographic characteristics, and access to health services found that longer-term Hispanic immigrants (> or =15 years) experienced a nearly four-fold greater risk of obesity than did recent immigrants (<5 years). CONCLUSIONS: The higher risk for obesity associated with length of residence may be due to acculturation processes such as the adoption of the unhealthy dietary practices (i.e., a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables) and sedentary lifestyles of the host country. The results of this study may facilitate the planning of public health interventions that are directed at subgroups of the Hispanic population.},

We examined findings from the nationally representative Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Surveys during 1991-2007, and fit regression models estimating average annual changes and tested time trends, and age, gender and ethnic differences. US adolescents had less PA but more sedentary behaviours than recommended, but showed no clear evidence of becoming less active. In 2007, 24.9{\%} reported on average spending >/=3 h of screen time per day for non-school work; only 34.7{\%} met the current PA recommendations, and it (25.6{\%}) was even lower in girls. The prevalence of having sufficient vigorous PA changed little between 1993 and 2005 (from 65.8{\%} to 64.1{\%}). Encouraging changes regarding TV viewing time and physical education (PE) were detected. PE daily attendance rate and exercising >20 min during an average PE class increased significantly, while watching TV >/=3 h d(-1) decreased significantly in recent years. Considerable sex, age and ethnic differences existed in the patterns and trends. These national data show no clear evidence of declining PA among US adolescents in recent years. Reduced PA is not likely the major explanation of the recent increase in obesity among US adolescents.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: This study developed and tested algorithms to identify outdoor walking trips from portable global positioning system (GPS) units in free-living conditions. METHODS:: The study included a calibration and a validation phase. For the calibration phase, we determined the best algorithm from 35 person-days of data. Measures of agreement regarding the daily number and duration of diary-reported and GPS-identified trips were used. In the validation phase, the best algorithm was applied to an additional and separate 136 person-days of diary and GPS data. RESULTS:: The preferred algorithm in the calibration phase, resulted in 90{\%} of trips identified from the GPS data being found in the diary, whereas 81{\%} of trips reported in the diary being found in the GPS data. The preferred algorithm used (1) a maximum 3-minute gap between points to define a trip, (2) at least five or more minutes of continuous GPS points, (3) a speed range between 2 km/h and 8.0 km/h, (4) at least 30m of displacement between the start and end points of a trip, and (5) merged walking trips when the time gap between trips was less than 3 minutes. With the validation data, substantial agreement between the GPS and the diary was achieved, with 86{\%} of trips identified from the GPS data found in the diary and 77{\%} of trips reported in the diary found in the GPS data. CONCLUSION:: The algorithm identified free-living walking trips of more than 5 minutes in duration. The ability to identify outdoor walking trips from GPS data can be improved by reducing recording intervals used in the GPS units and monitoring participant compliance. Further research is desirable to determine whether concurrent wearing an accelerometer may improve the ability to detect walking more accurately.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of the Fitbit wireless activity tracker in assessing energy expenditure (EE) for different activities.

METHODS: Twenty participants (10 males, 10 females) wore the Fitbit Classic wireless activity tracker on the hip and the Oxycon Mobile portable metabolic system (criterion). Participants performed walking and running trials on a treadmill and a simulated free-living activity routine. Paired t tests were used to test for differences between estimated (Fitbit) and criterion (Oxycon) kcals for each of the activities.

RESULTS: Mean bias for estimated energy expenditure for all activities was -4.5 ± 1.0 kcals/6 min (95{\%} limits of agreement: -25.2 to 15.8 kcals/6 min). The Fitbit significantly underestimated EE for cycling, laundry, raking, treadmill (TM) 3 mph at 5{\%} grade, ascent/descent stairs, and TM 4 mph at 5{\%} grade, and significantly overestimated EE for carrying groceries. Energy expenditure estimated by the Fitbit was not significantly different than EE calculated from the Oxycon Mobile for 9 activities.

CONCLUSION: The Fitbit worn on the hip significantly underestimates EE of activities. The variability in underestimation of EE for the different activities may be problematic for weight loss management applications since accurate EE estimates are important for tracking/monitoring energy deficit.},

STUDY DESIGN: Adult participants in the 2002 Styles surveys answered questions about their weekly TV viewing, knowledge, and rules. TV viewing time of children of the adult participants (520 boys and 525 girls) age 10 to 18 years was also collected. Associations between hours of child TV viewing and parental TV viewing, parental knowledge, and parental rules were quantified using linear regression techniques. RESULTS: Variables included in multivariate regression models accounted for 8{\%} to 18{\%} of the variance in TV viewing among boys and girls. Parent TV viewing was significantly associated with TV viewing in 10- to 12-year-old and 16- to 18-year-old boys and girls. Knowledge was not associated with TV viewing in boys and girls in this sample. Rules were associated with TV viewing in boys and girls of all ages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that parental TV viewing and rules limiting their child's TV time may play an important role in children's weekly TV viewing time.},

abstract = {An emerging body of evidence suggests that sedentary behavior (SB) is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. Recent data suggest that multi-domain SB has detrimental associations with BMI, waist circumference (WC), and nonadiposity-related (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure) cardiometabolic risk markers. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the extent to which the associations between SB and nonadiposity-related cardiometabolic risk markers are explained by adiposity markers. Subjects were 5,067 Health Survey for England (HSE) 2008 respondents (2,552 men) aged 16-65 years. The measurements protocol involved self-reports of television time, other recreational sitting, occupational sitting/standing, physical activity and objective measures of weight, height, WC, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, SBP, and DBP. BMI or WC adjustments of the multivariable models looking at the associations between SB and nonadiposity markers attenuated all associations towards the null. Using established logistic regression-based algorithms we calculated that a large percentage of the associations between SB time and nonadiposity risk factors is explained by BMI or WC (range: 27.3-95.9{\%}). Future longitudinal studies should further examine the mediatory role of adiposity in explaining the associations between SB and cardiometabolic risk.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate a peer modelling, rewards and pedometer-feedback intervention designed to increase children's physical activity and which uses the same behaviour-change principles underlying the Food Dude Healthy Eating Programme. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study was conducted in two primary schools in Wales. Participants were 47 children (21 boys, 26 girls) from the experimental school and 53 children (29 boys, 24 girls) from a matched control school, aged 9-11 years. Children in the experimental school took part in the intervention; over 8 days they were introduced to fictional role models (the Fit n' Fun Dudes) via visual and audio intervention materials and received small rewards when their daily pedometer step counts increased by 1500 steps per day relative to their baselines. Pedometer measures were taken from children in both schools at baseline, intervention (baseline 2 for the control school) and 12-week follow-up. RESULTS: Among experimental girls, steps per day were significantly higher during the intervention (14 686+/-2540) and at follow-up (13 737+/-3288) compared to baseline (10 864+/-2481, P<0.001) and control girls (P<0.005). Experimental boys showed significantly higher daily steps during the intervention compared to baseline (16 237+/-4204 cf. 13 452+/-3258, P<0.001) and control boys (P<0.005). There were no significant differences between activity levels of experimental and control boys at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention resulted in substantial increases in children's physical activity, which was well maintained over a 12-week period in girls.},

Such messages can be either effective or ineffective because they can normalise either desirable or undesirable conduct. To examine the implications in an environmental context, visitors to Arizonas Petrified Forest National Park were exposed to messages that admonished against the theft of petrified wood. In addition, the messages conveyed information either about descriptive norms (the levels of others behaviour) or injunctive norms (the levels of others disapproval) regarding such thievery. Results showed that focusing message recipients on descriptive normative information was most likely to increase theft, whereas focusing them on injunctive normative information was most likely to suppress it. Recommendations are offered for optimising the impact of normative messages in situations characterised by objectionable levels of undesirable conduct.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: This study assessed the rates and correlates of adolescents' compliance with national guidelines for physical activity. METHODS: A cross-sectional phone survey of adolescents and their parents was conducted in the 100 largest cities in the United States in 2005. Adolescents ages 14-17 years (n = 6125) were asked how many days during the previous week and during a typical week they were physically active for at least 60 minutes. Compliance was defined as 5+ days per week. Parents provided data on teen's age and race/ethnicity, parental education level, annual household income, and region of residence. Associations among these variables and compliance with physical activity guidelines were examined. RESULTS: Approximately 40{\%} of the females and 57{\%} of the males complied with the national physical activity guidelines. Logistic regression indicated that for both genders, compliance was significantly associated with having higher household income and that, for females only, compliance declined significantly with age. Region of residence did not predict compliance for either gender. CONCLUSION: A majority of the girls and a large portion of the boys failed to meet the current guidelines, thereby increasing their risks of multiple health problems. Targeting intervention resources for low income teens and older adolescent teen girls is recommended.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Physical activity (PA) begins to decline in adolescence with a concomitant increase in weight. We hypothesized that a vicious circle may arise between decreasing PA and weight gain from adolescence to early adulthood. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: PA and self-perceived physical fitness assessed in adolescents (16-18 years of age) were used to predict the development of obesity (BMI > or =30 kg/m(2)) and abdominal obesity (waist >/=88 cm in females and > or =102 cm in males) at age 25 in 4,240 twin individuals (90{\%} of twins born in Finland, 1975-1979). Ten 25-year-old monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs who were discordant for obesity (with a 16 kg weight difference) were then carefully evaluated for current PA (using a triaxial accelerometer), total energy expenditure (TEE, assessed by means of the doubly labeled water (DLW) method), and basal metabolic rate (BMR, assessed by indirect calorimetry). RESULTS: Physical inactivity in adolescence strongly predicted the risk for obesity (odds ratio (OR) 3.9, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.4-10.9) and abdominal obesity (4.8, 1.9-12.0) at age 25, even after adjusting for baseline and current BMI. Poor physical fitness in adolescence also increased the risk for overall obesity (5.1, 2.0-12.7) and abdominal obesity (3.2, 1.5-6.7) in adulthood. Physical inactivity was both causative and secondary to the development of obesity discordance in the MZ pairs. TEE did not differ between the MZ co-twins. PA was lower whereas BMR was higher in the obese co-twins. DISCUSSION: Physical inactivity in adolescence strongly and independently predicts total (and especially) abdominal obesity in young adulthood, favoring the development of a self-perpetuating vicious circle of obesity and physical inactivity. Physical activity should therefore be seriously recommended for obesity prevention in the young.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Spontaneous and transitory movement patterns are characteristic of children. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between short, frequent activity bouts and children's health. METHODS: Physical activity was recorded every 2 s by accelerometry (ActiGraph GT1M) for seven days in 47 boys (age 8-10 years). Summary activity measures and activity pattern characteristics (frequency, intensity and duration of > or = 4 s [short] and > or = 5 min [long] bouts of > or= light [> or = LIGHT], > or = moderate [> or = MOD], > or = vigorous [> or = VIG], and > or = hard [> or = HARD] intensity activity) were recorded. Microvascular function was assessed using laser Doppler perfusion imaging as the forearm skin blood flow response to the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine (endothelial dependent vasodilator) and sodium nitroprusside (endothelial independent vasodilator) at rest and following maximal exercise. Waist circumference, resting blood pressure and aerobic fitness (VO(2peak)) were measured. RESULTS: The intensity of short and long > or = LIGHT bouts and the frequency of short and long > or =MOD bouts were correlated with waist circumference (r = - 0.42 to -0.52, p < 0.01) and VO(2peak) (r = 0.42 to 0.47, p < 0.01), but not when scaled for lean body mass. The frequency of short and long > or =LIGHT bouts were associated with change in endothelial function from rest to post-exercise (r = 0.34 to 0.55, p < 0.05). No relationships were evident between blood pressure and activity. CONCLUSION: The relationship between the frequency of short bouts (> or =4 s) of activity and health was as strong as relationships identified between longer bouts (> or =5 min) and health. This is encouraging as sporadic intermittent activity is characteristic of children's activity pattern.},

With most infectious diseases largely at bay in the developed world, the greatest contributors to suboptimal health today are largely behavioral. For example, there are three behavioral risk factors-tobacco use, poor diet, and inactivity-that contribute to four chronic diseases: heart disease, type 2 diabetes, lung disease, and some cancers. Together, these behaviors account for more than 50{\%} of preventable deaths (see the Web site 3four50.com). While medical advances will surely continue, it is likely that the next great advancements in health in the 21st century will occur via more effective behavior management.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the ability of alternative measures of physical activity and fitness to quantify associations with health outcomes. METHODS: Associations between a range of subjective and objective physical activity and fitness measures and cardiometabolic risk factors were examined using data from 1,631 Australians aged 26-36 years. Anthropometry, fitness, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipids were measured at study clinics. Participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day pedometer diaries; they also reported sedentary behavior (sitting, television viewing). RESULTS: In men and women, associations were strongest for fitness, with those in the highest (vs. lowest) fitness quarter having a 75{\%} to 80{\%} lower prevalence of two or more primary risk factors (waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin resistance). In men, a 60{\%} to 70{\%} reduced prevalence of two or more risk factors was observed across extreme quarters of IPAQ leisure, IPAQ vigorous, sitting duration, and pedometer measures. Similar reductions in prevalence were observed only across extreme quarters of pedometer activity and television viewing in women. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between alternative measures and cardiometabolic risk were relatively independent, suggesting that a range of physical activity and fitness measures may be needed to most accurately quantify associations between physical activity and health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developing and evaluating interventions to influence students' opportunities for healthful choices has been a focus of school-based health promotion research; however, few studies have examined the sustainability of these programs and viability of continued organizational implementation. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to determine the maintenance of Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) school-level changes in former intervention (n = 56) and former comparison (n = 20) schools 5 years post-intervention. Twelve schools unexposed to CATCH were measured as controls. Macronutrient content of 5 days of school lunch menus, amount and type of physical education (PE) classes, and health instruction practices in the classroom were assessed. An institutionalization score for schools was developed, using program maintenance variables: {\%} kcal from fat and saturated fat in school lunches, {\%} PE class spent in vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and class time devoted to CATCH topics. RESULTS: Menus from 50{\%} of former intervention cafeterias met the Eat Smart guidelines for fat, compared to 10{\%} of former control cafeterias and 17{\%} of unexposed school cafeterias (P < 0.005). There were no significant differences in implementation of CATCH PE goals between conditions. Although the total time spent teaching CATCH was low in former CATCH schools, the former intervention schools spent significantly more time teaching CATCH and taught more lessons as compared to former comparison schools. Former intervention schools had a higher mean institutionalization score than former comparison schools (P < 0.001). Training had the greatest impact on maintenance of CATCH. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that changes in the school environment to support healthful behaviors can be maintained over time. Staff training is an important factor in achieving institutionalization of these programs.},

abstract = {This study was designed to determine the number of days of pedometer monitoring necessary to achieve reliable and valid estimates of a 1-year average of step counts in adults based on either consecutive days (CD) or random days (RD) of data collection. Twenty-three participants (16 women; M age = 38 years, SD = 9.9) wore a Yamax SW 200 pedometer and recorded their step counts for 365 consecutive days. Nine measurement periods of various lengths were selected (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days). Each measurement period was randomly selected 10 times each for CD and RD from the larger database. For reliability and validity, two-way intraclass correlation coefficients and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were calculated, respectively. The year-round average was considered the criterion measure of the "true" habitual physical activity. Data were analyzed separately by CD and RD. At least 5 CD or 6 RD were necessary to achieve an ICC of .80. A minimum of 30 CD or 14 RD were necessary to achieve an MAPE lower than 10{\%}. These findings provide researchers and practitioners with useful information to determine appropriate measurement length and the method of data selection based on a desired level of reliability and validity.},

Collective efficacy is frequently considered a "cause", but we hypothesized that environmental features might be the foundation for or the etiology of personal reports of neighborhood collective efficacy. We analyzed data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study (LAFANS) together with geographical data from Los Angeles County to determine which social and environmental features were associated with personal reports of collective efficacy, including presence of parks, alcohol outlets, elementary schools and fast food outlets. We used multi-level modeling controlling for age, education, annual family income, sex, marital status, employment and race/ethnicity at the individual level. At the tract level, we controlled for tract-level disadvantage, the number of off-sale alcohol outlets per roadway mile, the number of parks and the number of fast food outlets within the tract and within 1/2 mile of the tract's boundaries. We found that parks were independently and positively associated with collective efficacy; alcohol outlets were negatively associated with collective efficacy only when tract-level disadvantage was not included in the model. Fast food outlets and elementary schools were not linearly related to collective efficacy. Certain environmental features may set the stage for neighborhood social interactions, thus serving as a foundation for underlying health and well-being. Altering these environmental features may have greater than expected impact on health.},

In all: •60{\%} of U.S. adults say they track their weight, diet, or exercise routine. •33{\%} of U.S. adults track health indicators or symptoms, like blood pressure, blood sugar, headaches, or sleep patterns. •12{\%} of U.S. adults track health indicators or symptoms for a loved one. However, their tracking is often informal: •49{\%} of trackers say they keep track of progress “in their heads.” •34{\%} say they track the data on paper, like in a notebook or journal. •21{\%} say they use some form of technology to track their health data, such as a spreadsheet, website, app, or device. This question allowed multiple responses, but in sum: 50{\%} of trackers record their notes in some organized way, such as on paper or using technology, and 44{\%} of trackers do so only in their heads.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mobile applications (apps) have potential for helping people increase their physical activity, but little is known about the behavior change techniques marketed in these apps.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to characterize the behavior change techniques represented in online descriptions of top-ranked apps for physical activity.

METHODS: Top-ranked apps (n=167) were identified on August 28, 2013, and coded using the Coventry, Aberdeen and London-Revised (CALO-RE) taxonomy of behavior change techniques during the following month. Analyses were conducted during 2013.

RESULTS: Most descriptions of apps incorporated fewer than four behavior change techniques. The most common techniques involved providing instruction on how to perform exercises, modeling how to perform exercises, providing feedback on performance, goal-setting for physical activity, and planning social support/change. A latent class analysis revealed the existence of two types of apps, educational and motivational, based on their configurations of behavior change techniques.

CONCLUSIONS: Behavior change techniques are not widely marketed in contemporary physical activity apps. Based on the available descriptions and functions of the observed techniques in contemporary health behavior theories, people may need multiple apps to initiate and maintain behavior change. This audit provides a starting point for scientists, developers, clinicians, and consumers to evaluate and enhance apps in this market.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of sedentary behavior on blood pressure (BP) in young children using different indicators of sedentariness. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A rural Midwestern US community. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3 to 8 years (N = 111). Intervention Adiposity was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Objective measurements of sedentary activity were obtained from the accelerometers that participants wore continuously for 7 days. Measurements of television (TV) viewing, computer, and screen time (TV + computer) were obtained via parent report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic and diastolic BP. RESULTS: The sample spent a mean of 5 hours per day in sedentary activities, of which 1.5 hours were screen time. Accelerometer-determined sedentary activity was not significantly related to systolic BP or diastolic BP after controlling for age, sex, height, and percentage of body fat. However, TV viewing and screen time, but not computer use, were positively associated with both systolic BP and diastolic BP after adjusting for potential confounders. Participants in the lowest tertile of TV and screen time had significantly lower levels of systolic and diastolic BP than participants in the upper tertile. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behaviors, particularly TV viewing and screen time, were associated with BP in children, independent of body composition. Other factors that occur during excessive screen time (eg, food consumption) should also be considered in the context of sedentary behavior and BP development in children.},

abstract = {The primary aim of the Trial of Activity in Adolescent Girls (TAAG) is to test an intervention to reduce by half the age-related decline in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in middle school girls. The intervention will be evaluated using a group-randomized trial involving 36 middle schools. The primary endpoint is the mean difference in intensity-weighted minutes (i.e., MET-minutes) of MVPA between intervention and comparison schools assessed using accelerometry. The TAAG study design calls for two cross-sectional samples, one drawn from 6th graders at the beginning of the study and the second drawn from 8th graders at the end of the study following the 2-year implementation of the intervention. An important strength of this design over a cohort design is the consistency with the goals of TAAG, which focus on environmental-level rather than individual-level interventions to produce change. The study design specifies a recruitment rate of 80{\%} and a smaller sample of girls at baseline (n=48 per school) than at follow-up (n=96 per school). A two-stage model will be used to test the primary hypothesis. In the first stage, MET-weighted minutes of MVPA will be regressed on school, time (baseline or follow-up), their interaction, ethnicity and week of data collection. The second stage analysis will be conducted on the 72 adjusted means from the first stage. In the main-effects model, we will regress the follow-up school mean MET-weighted minutes of MVPA on study condition, adjusting for the baseline school mean. The TAAG study addresses an important health behavior, and also advances the field of group-randomized trials through the use of a study design and analysis plan tailored to serve the main study hypothesis.},

abstract = {Sedentariness is associated with obesity. We examined whether people with sedentary jobs are equally inactive during their work days and leisure days. We enrolled 21 subjects of varying weight and body fat (11 men:10 women, 38 +/- 8 years, 83 +/- 17 kg, BMI 28 +/- 5 kg/m(2), 29 +/- 11 fat kg, 35 +/- 9{\%} fat). All subjects continued their usual work and leisure-time activities whilst we measured daily activity and body postures for 10 days. The data supported our hypothesis that people sit more at work compared to leisure (597 +/- 122 min/day cf 484 +/- 83 min/day; P < 0.0001). The mean difference was 110 +/- 99 min/day. Similarly, work days were associated with less standing (341 +/- 97 min/day; P = 0.002) than leisure days (417 +/- 101 min/day). Although the walking bouts did not differ significantly between work and leisure (46 +/- 9 vs. 42 +/- 9 walking bouts/day); the mean free-living velocity of a walk at work was 1.08 +/- 0.28 mph and on leisure days was 0.94 +/- 0.24 mph (P = 0.03) and the average time spent walking was 322 +/- 91 min on work days and 380 +/- 108 min on leisure days (P = 0.03). Estimates of the daily energetic cost of walking approximated 527 +/- 220 kcal/day for work days and 586 +/- 326 kcal/day for leisure days (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). Work days are associated with more sitting and less walking/standing time than leisure days. We suggest a need to develop approaches to free people from their chairs and render them more active.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity has many positive effects on children's health while TV viewing has been associated with adverse health outcomes. Many children do not meet physical activity recommendations and exceed TV viewing guidelines. Parents are likely to be an important influence on their children's behaviour. There is an absence of information about the associations between parents' and children's physical activity and TV viewing. METHODS: Year 6 children and their parent were recruited from 40 primary schools. Results are presented for the 340 parent-child dyads with accelerometer data that met a > or = 3 day inclusion criteria and the 431 parent-child dyads with complete self-reported TV viewing. Over 80{\%} of the dyads with valid TV viewing data included mothers and their child. Mean minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), minutes of sedentary time per day and counts per minute were assessed by accelerometer. Self-reported hours of TV viewing were coded into 3 groups (< 2 hours per day, 2-4 hours per day and >4 hours per day. Linear and multi-nominal regression models were run by child gender to examine parent-child associations. RESULTS: In linear regression models there was an association for the overall sedentary time of girls and their parents (t = 2.04. p = .020) but there was no association between girls' and parents' physical activity. There were no associations between parents' and boys' sedentary or physical activity time. For girls, the risk of watching more than 4 hours of TV per day, (reference = 2 hours of TV per day), was 3.67 times higher if the girl's parent watched 2-4 hours of TV per day (p = 0.037). For boys, the risk of watching more than 4 hours of TV per day, was 10.47 times higher if the boy's parent watched more than 4 hours of TV per day (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: There are associations in the sedentary time of parents and daughters. Higher parental TV viewing was associated with an increased risk of high levels of TV viewing for both boys and girls. There were no associations between the time that parents and children spend engaged in physical activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examines the amount of recess that children 8 to 9 years of age receive in the United States and compares the group classroom behavior of children receiving daily recess with that of children not receiving daily recess. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a public-use data set, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999, third-grade data set. Children were categorized into 2 levels of recess exposure, that is, none/minimal break (<1 break of 15 minutes/day) or some recess. Some recess was further categorized into 5 levels on the basis of frequency and duration of recess. Child, parent, school, and classroom characteristics of those with and without recess were compared. The group classroom behavior was assessed by using the teacher's rating of class behavior. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 10301 to 11624 children 8 to 9 years of age. There were equal numbers of boys and girls (boys: 50.3{\%}). Children exposed to none/minimal break (30{\%}) were much more likely to be black, to be from families with lower incomes and lower levels of education, to live in large cities, to be from the Northeast or South, and to attend public school, compared with those with recess. Teacher's rating of classroom behavior scores were better for children with some recess than for those with none/minimal break. This finding was maintained in multivariate regression analysis. However, among children receiving daily recess, the teacher's rating of class behavior scores did not differ significantly according to the level of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that, among 8- to 9-year-old children, having > or =1 daily recess period of >15 minutes in length was associated with better teacher's rating of class behavior scores. This study suggests that schoolchildren in this age group should be provided with daily recess.},

Mitigating this crisis will require a major transformation of healthcare to be proactive, preventive, patient-centered, and evidence-based with a focus on improving quality-of-life. Information technology, networking, and biomedical engineering are likely to be essential in making this transformation possible with the help of advances, such as sensor technology, mobile computing, machine learning, etc. This paper has three themes: 1) motivation for a transformation of healthcare; 2) description of how information technology and engineering can support this transformation with the help of computational models; and 3) a technical overview of several research areas that illustrate the need for mathematical modeling approaches, ranging from sparse sampling to behavioral phenotyping and early detection. A key tenet of this paper concerns complementing prior work on patient-specific modeling and simulation by modeling neuropsychological, behavioral, and social phenomena. The resulting models, in combination with frequent or continuous measurements, are likely to be key components of health interventions to enhance health and wellbeing and the provision of healthcare.},

Results showed significant physical fitness improvements during the school year, with little or no changes in the summer holidays. Children who reported less than 30 minutes of daily participation in physical activity demonstrated lower prevalence rates for overweight and obesity as well as superior fitness performance. The detrimental effect of the summer break on the progress of physical fitness was less in children who did participate in physical activity than in those who did not. Longitudinal modelling using generalized estimating equations demonstrated that physical activity is a major contributing factor for obesity over time, masking the singular effect of various fitness parameters. It is concluded that pre-adolescent children advance in physical fitness mainly during the school year, with physical activity being a beneficial countermeasure for the development of obesity.},

The purpose of the present paper is to describe a SE framework that guided the intervention and measurement plans for a specific study.

METHODS: As part of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, 5 national school-based surveys were conducted biennially from 1999 through 2007. Each survey used a 3-stage cross-sectional sample of students in grades 9 to 12 and provided self-reported data from approximately 14,000 students. Logistic regression models that controlled for sex, race/ethnicity, and grade were used to analyze secular trends. RESULTS: During 1999 to 2007, prevalence estimates for regular participation in moderate and vigorous physical activity, participation in daily PE classes, and being physically active in PE classes did not change significantly among female, male, white, black, or Hispanic students. In contrast, the prevalence of TV viewing for 2 or fewer hours on a school day increased significantly among female, male, white, black, and Hispanic students and among students in every grade except 12th grade. CONCLUSIONS: Among US adolescents, no significant progress has been made toward increasing participation in physical activity or school PE classes; however, improvements have been made in reducing TV viewing time.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precursors of marijuana use in early adolescence are largely unknown because studies generally focus on marijuana use among older adolescents or adults. METHODS: In this study, we examined precursors of marijuana use in a sample of 1023 Dutch early adolescents (aged 11-14 at Time 1) who were never-marijuana user at baseline, by applying a 3-wave longitudinal design. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used as a theoretical framework and posits that marijuana-specific cognitions (i.e., positive and negative expectancies, evaluative attitude, social approval, and self-efficacy) are antecedents of marijuana use and that this relationship is mediated by the intention to start using marijuana. RESULTS: In accordance with these premises, our results indicated that evaluative attitude, social approval, and self-efficacy at Time 1 are related to marijuana use at Time 3 (20 months follow-up) via the intention to start using marijuana at Time 2 (8 months follow-up). More specifically, the structural equation models showed that more positive marijuana attitudes, more approval from the social environment, and lower self-efficacy were related to marijuana use initiation through a stronger intention to start using marijuana. CONCLUSION: This outcome is important for prevention efforts in that our results underline the importance of weakening adolescents' positive attitudes toward marijuana, decrease social approval of marijuana use, and stimulating the development of early adolescents' refusal skills with respect to marijuana use.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technological advances have seen a burgeoning industry for accelerometer-based wearable activity monitors targeted at the consumer market. The purpose of this study was to determine the convergent validity of a selection of consumer-level accelerometer-based activity monitors.

METHODS: 21 healthy adults wore seven consumer-level activity monitors (Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip, Jawbone UP, Misfit Shine, Nike Fuelband, Striiv Smart Pedometer and Withings Pulse) and two research-grade accelerometers/multi-sensor devices (BodyMedia SenseWear, and ActiGraph GT3X+) for 48-hours. Participants went about their daily life in free-living conditions during data collection. The validity of the consumer-level activity monitors relative to the research devices for step count, moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sleep and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) was quantified using Bland-Altman analysis, median absolute difference and Pearson's correlation.

RESULTS: All consumer-level activity monitors correlated strongly (r > 0.8) with research-grade devices for step count and sleep time, but only moderately-to-strongly for TDEE (r = 0.74-0.81) and MVPA (r = 0.52-0.91). Median absolute differences were generally modest for sleep and steps (<10{\%} of research device mean values for the majority of devices) moderate for TDEE (<30{\%} of research device mean values), and large for MVPA (26-298{\%}). Across the constructs examined, the Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip and Withings Pulse performed most strongly.

CONCLUSIONS: In free-living conditions, the consumer-level activity monitors showed strong validity for the measurement of steps and sleep duration, and moderate valid for measurement of TDEE and MVPA. Validity for each construct ranged widely between devices, with the Fitbit One, Fitbit Zip and Withings Pulse being the strongest performers.},

abstract = {Important aspects of the inverse relation between physical activity and colon cancer risk are still under discussion. In 2000-2003, 239 incident cases of colorectal cancer confirmed by histopathology and 239 hospital-based controls, matched by age and gender, were enrolled. In standardized interviews, data on occupational and recreational physical activity for ages 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 years were collected from 98 colon cancer cases, 141 rectal cancer cases, and from 193 controls. Besides lifestyle and sociodemographic characteristics, a detailed food frequency questionnaire was assessed. In multivariate logistic regression for colon cancer, significant risk reductions for the highest quartile of total physical activity were found for almost all ages. For lifetime mean physical activity, the multivariate odds ratio for the highest quartile was 0.37 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.17, 0.83]. For lifelong constantly high-exercisers compared with lifelong non-exercisers an odds ratio of 0.26 (95{\%} CI 0.08, 0.84) was estimated. For rectal cancer, no consistent association with physical activity was found. No confounding effects were observed but the authors found effect modification with total energy intake. These data support an inverse association of colon cancer risk and physical activity which is most expressed if activity is kept up throughout life.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this commentary is to demonstrate the growing interest of state legislatures in adopting policies that promote physical activity in schools and communities through partnerships with school districts and local governments. METHOD: Interviews were conducted with state legislators that have sponsored legislation enacted into law. The author and his staff also surveyed proposed and enacted bills during the 2007 and 2008 legislative sessions. RESULTS: The majority of states have considered or enacted legislation in recent years that addresses physical activity in schools or communities through partnerships with school districts, cities and counties responsible for implementing state policy. These policies may seek to directly impact a targeted audience (children in school by requiring minimum amounts of physical education during the day) or provide broad guidelines for implementation by other entities with direct authority (local governments charged with preparing comprehensive land use plans under other statutes). CONCLUSION: As research demonstrates the increasing costs of public health care associated with physically inactive children and adults, and the public health benefits that can be gained through specific policy interventions, state legislatures have been willing to act to promote physical activity. A key is translating research into understandable policy applications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The United States is currently in an age of obesity and inactivity despite increasing public awareness and scientific knowledge of detrimental long-term health effects of this lifestyle. Behavior-tracking diaries offer an effective strategy for physical activity adherence and weight management. Furthermore, Web-based physical activity diaries can engage meaningful partners in people's social networks through fun online gaming interactions and generate motivational mechanisms for effective behavioral change and positive health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Wellness Partners (WP) is a Web-based intervention in the form of a physical activity diary with social networking and game features. Two versions were designed and developed for the purpose of this study-"Diary" only and "Diary+Game". The objectives of this study included pilot testing the research process of this intervention design, implementation, evaluation, and exploring the effectiveness of social gaming features on adult participants' physical activity and anthropometric measures.

METHODS: We conducted a field experiment with randomized crossover design. Assessments occurred at baseline, first follow-up (FU, 5-8 weeks after using one version of WP), and second FU (5-8 weeks of using the other version of WP). In the control condition, participants started with the "Diary" version of WP while in the experimental condition, participants started with the "Diary+Game" version of WP. A total of 54 adults (egos) ages 44-88, and their family and friends (alters) ages 17-69 participated in the study in ego-network groups. Both egos and their alters completed online surveys about their exercise habits. In addition, egos completed anthropometric measurements of BMI, fat percentage, and fat mass by bioimpedance.

RESULTS: From October 2009 to May 2010, flyers, emails, and Web advertisements yielded 335 volunteers who were screened. Rolling recruitment resulted in enrollment of 142 qualified participants in 54 ego-network groups, which were randomly assigned to a study condition. The final analytic sample included 87 individuals from 41 groups. Data were collected from December 2009 to August 2010, and data analysis was completed in 2011. Overall, the participants were given access to the intervention for 10-13 weeks. Statistical analysis suggested an increase in self-reported exercise frequency (mean days per week) from baseline (2.57, SD 1.92) to first FU (3.21, SD 1.74) in both conditions. Stronger effects were seen in the condition where Diary+Game was played first, especially in network groups with larger age variation between the alters and egos. Overall, the decrease in egos' BMI was statistically significant from baseline to first FU, with greater decrease for those in the Diary+Game first condition (-0.26 vs -0.16 in the Diary first condition).

CONCLUSIONS: The Wellness Partners program increased physical activity among participants and resulted in health benefits among the egos. Web-based diary interventions designed with social gaming features hold potential to promote active lifestyles for middle-age adults and people in their social networks.},

abstract = {Tudor-Locke and colleagues previously assessed steps/day for 1 year. The aim of this study was to use this data set to introduce a novel approach for the investigation of whether individual’s physical activity exhibits periodicity fluctuating round a mean and, if so, the degree of fluctuation and whether the mean changes over time. Twenty-three participants wore a pedometer for 365 days, recorded steps/day and whether the day was a workday. Fourier transform of each participant’s daily steps data showed the physical activity had a periodicity of 7 days in half of the participants, matching the periodicity of the workday pattern. Activity level remained stable in half of the participants, decreased in ten participants and increased in two. In conclusion, the 7-day periodicity of activity in half of the participants and correspondence with the workday pattern suggest a social or environmental influence. The novel analytical approach introduced herein allows the determination of the periodicity of activity, the degree of variability in activity that is tolerated during day-to-day life and whether the activity level is stable. Results from the use of these methodologies in larger data sets may enable a more focused approach to the design of interventions that aim to increase activity.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 6-month impact of a physical activity (PA) multilevel intervention on activity patterns and psychological predictors of PA among adolescents. The intervention was directed at changing knowledge and attitudes and at providing social support and environmental conditions that encourage PA of adolescents inside and outside school. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Randomised, controlled ongoing field trial (ICAPS) in middle-school's first-level adolescents from eight schools selected in the department of the Bas-Rhin (Eastern France) with a cohort of 954 adolescents (92{\%} of the eligible students) initially aged 11.7+/-0.6 y. The 6-month changes in participation in leisure organised PA (LOPA), high sedentary (SED) behaviour (>3 h/day), self-efficacy (SELF) and intention (INTENT) towards PA were analysed after controlling for baseline measures and different covariables (age, overweight, socioprofessional occupation), taking into account the cluster randomisation design. RESULTS: The proportion of intervention adolescents not engaged in organised PA was reduced by 50{\%} whereas it was unchanged among control students. After adjustment for baseline covariables, LOPA participation significantly increased among the intervention adolescents (odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) (OR)=3.38 (1.42-8.05) in girls; 1.73 (1.12-2.66) in boys), while high SED was reduced (OR=0.54 (0.38-0.77) in girls; 0.52 (0.35-0.76) in boys). The intervention improved SELF in girls, whatever their baseline LOPA (P<10(-4)) and INTENT in girls with no baseline LOPA (P=0.04). SELF tended to improve in boys with no baseline LOPA, without reaching statistical significance. When included in the regression, follow-up LOPA was associated with improvement of SELF in girls (P=0.02) and of INTENT in girls with no baseline PA (P<0.02). The intervention effect was then attenuated. CONCLUSION: After 6 months of intervention, ICAPS was associated with a significant improvement of activity patterns and psychological predictors, indicating a promising approach for modifying the long-term PA level of adolescents.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies examining the relationship between physical activity levels and broad-based measures of psychological wellbeing in adolescents have been limited by not controlling for potentially confounding variables. The present study examined the relationship between adolescents' self-reported physical activity level, sedentary behaviour and psychological wellbeing; while controlling for a broad range of sociodemographic, health and developmental factors. METHODS: The study entailed a cross-sectional school-based survey in ten British towns. Two thousand six hundred and twenty three adolescents (aged 13-16 years) reported physical activity levels, patterns of sedentary behaviour (TV/computer/video usage) and completed the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ). RESULTS: Lower levels of self-reported physical activity and higher levels of sedentary behaviour showed graded associations with higher SDQ total difficulties scores, both for boys (P < 0.001) and girls (P < 0.02) after adjustment for age and town. Additional adjustment for social class, number of parents, predicted school examination results, body mass index, ethnicity, alcohol intake and smoking status had little effect on these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of self-reported physical activity are independently associated with diminished psychological wellbeing among adolescents. Longitudinal studies may provide further insights into the relationship between wellbeing and activity levels in this population. Ultimately, randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effects of increasing physical activity on psychological wellbeing among adolescents.},

Knowledge about whether behaviors cluster together could inform interventions. STUDY DESIGN: Estimates of time spent in 6 sedentary behaviors (watching television, talking on the telephone, using a computer, listening to music, doing homework, reading) were cluster analyzed for a sample of 878 adolescents (52{\%} girls, mean age = 12.7 years, 58{\%} Caucasian). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clusters were based on the sedentary behaviors listed above and compared on environmental variables (e.g., household rules), psychosocial variables (e.g., self-efficacy, enjoyment), and health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, diet). RESULTS: Four clusters emerged: low sedentary, medium sedentary, selective high sedentary, and high sedentary. Analyses revealed significant cluster differences for gender (p < .002), age (p < .002), body mass index (p < .001), physical activity (p < .01), and fiber intake (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest a limited number of distinct sedentary behavior patterns.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between potential social ecological correlates and self-reported short physical activity breaks during work hours (defined as any interruption in sitting time during a typical work hour) among a sample of employees who commonly sit for working tasks. METHODS: 801 employed adults aged 18-70years from metropolitan Melbourne, Australia were surveyed in 2009 about their short physical activity breaks from sitting during work hours and potential social ecological correlates of this behaviour. RESULTS: Men reported significantly more short physical activity breaks per work hour than did women (2.5 vs. 2.3 breaks/h, p=0.02). A multivariable linear regression analysis adjusting for clustering and meeting the public health physical activity recommendations showed that the factors associated with frequency of short physical activity breaks per work hour were perceptions of lack of time for short physical activity breaks for men (-0.31 breaks/h, 95{\%} confidence intervals [CI] -0.52, -0.09) and lack of information about taking short physical activity breaks for women (-0.20 breaks/h, CI -0.47, -0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that providing male employees with support for short physical activity breaks during work hours, and female employees with information on benefits of this behaviour may be useful for reducing workplace sedentary time.},

The effect of reducing television watching and other sedentary behaviors as a component of a comprehensive obesity treatment program has not been thoroughly tested. OBJECTIVE: To compare the influence of targeting decreases in sedentary behavior vs. increases in physical activity in the comprehensive treatment of obesity in 8- to 12-year-old children. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled outcome study. SETTING: Childhood obesity research clinic. DESIGN: Ninety families with obese 8- to 12-year-old children were randomly assigned to groups that were provided a comprehensive family-based behavioral weight control program that included dietary, and behavior change information but differed in whether sedentary or physically active behaviors were targeted and the degree of behavior change required. RESULTS: Results during 2 years showed that targeting either decreased sedentary behaviors or increased physical activity was associated with significant decreases in percent overweight and body fat and improved aerobic fitness. Self-reported activity minutes increased and targeted sedentary time decreased during treatment. Children substituted nontargeted sedentary behaviors for some of their targeted sedentary behaviors.

Coding was assessed for 12 BCTs (workshops) and for 17 BCTs (tutorials). Trainees completed a course evaluation. Methods improved agreement with expert consensus (p < .05) but not inter-coder agreement (p = .08, p = .57, respectively) and increased confidence for BCTs assessed (both p < .05). Methods were as effective as one another at improving coding competence (p = .55). Training was evaluated positively. The training improved agreement with expert consensus, confidence for BCTs assessed, coding competence but not inter-coder agreement. This varied according to BCT.},

abstract = {Given that recent literature reviews on physical activity in urban parks deliberately excluded qualitative findings, we reviewed qualitative research on this topic informed by a published classification scheme based on quantitative research. Twenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies relied mainly on semi-structured interviews with individuals or in focus groups; only five studies involved in situ observation. Our synthesis aligns with previous quantitative research showing that attributes including safety, aesthetics, amenities, maintenance, and proximity are important for encouraging park use. Furthermore, our synthesis of qualitative research suggests that perceptions of the social environment entwine inextricably with perceptions of the physical environment. If so, physical attributes of parks as well as perceptions of these attributes (formed in relation to broader social contexts) may influence physical activity patterns. Both qualitative and quantitative methods provide useful information for interpreting such patterns, and in particular, when designing and assessing interventions intended to improve the amount and intensity of physical activity.},

abstract = {This review describes current patterns and long-term trends (up to 50 years when possible) related to (a) physical activity, (b) employment and occupation, (c) travel behavior, (d) land use, and (e) related behaviors (e.g., television watching). On the basis of available data, the following trends were observed according to type of physical activity: relatively stable or slightly increasing levels of leisure-time physical activity, declining work-related activity, declining transportation activity, declining activity in the home, and increasing sedentary activity. These result in an overall trend of declining total physical activity. Large differences were noted in the rates of walking for transportation across metropolitan statistical areas. A strong linear increase existed in vehicle miles traveled per person over the past half century, coupled with a strong and consistent trend toward Americans living in suburbs. Although it is difficult to precisely quantify owing to the lack of long-term data, it is apparent that a combination of changes to the built environment and increases in the proportion of the population engaging in sedentary activities put the majority of the American population at high risk of physical inactivity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accelerometer use in physical activity research has become increasingly popular but is prone to problems with missing data, which complicate the data reduction and analysis process. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hypothesized compliance strategies on improving compliance with wearing a physical activity accelerometer in high school students. METHODS: Each of four local high schools was assigned to one of four compliance strategies: (1) receiving three phone calls, (2) completing a daily journal, (3) compensation contingent on number of complete (> or = 10 hours) days of data, and (4) control condition. Participants wore ActiGraph accelerometers for seven days to determine compliance and physical activity. RESULTS: The contingent group had the highest level of compliance with 96{\%} of the participants acquiring at least four of seven complete days of data. After controlling for grade level, school level percent minority students, and school level socioeconomic status (SES), the contingent group's compliance remained significantly higher (P = .04) than the journal (85{\%}), phone (72{\%}), and control (70{\%}) participants. CONCLUSIONS: The contingent compliance strategy improved the amount of time the students wore the monitor each day and, thus, the total number of days with > or =10 hours of data.},

@article{McEwen2003,
abstract = {Individual differences in the aging process can be conceptualized as an accumulation of wear and tear of daily experiences and major life stressors that interact with the genetic constitution and predisposing early life experiences. The neuroendocrine system, autonomic nervous system, and immune system are mediators of adaptation to challenges of daily life, referred to as allostasis, meaning “maintaining stability through change.” Physiological mediators such as adrenalin from the adrenal medulla, glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex, and cytokines from cells of the immune system act upon receptors in various tissues and organs to produce effects that are adaptive in the short run but can be damaging if the mediators are not shut off when no longer needed. When release of the mediators is not efficiently terminated, their effects on target cells are prolonged, leading to other consequences that may include receptor desensitization and tissue damage. This process has been named “allostatic load,” and it refers to the price the tissue or organ pays for an overactive or inefficiently managed allostatic response. Therefore, allostatic load refers to the “cost” of adaptation. This article discusses the mediators of allostasis and their contributions to allostatic load as well as their role in resilience of the aging organism to stressful experiences.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Hospitalization and surgery in older patients often leads to a loss of strength, mobility, and functional capacity. We tested the hypothesis that wireless accelerometry could be used to measure mobility during hospital recovery after cardiac surgery.

DESCRIPTION: We used an off-the-shelf fitness monitor to measure daily mobility in patients after surgery. Data were transmitted wirelessly, aggregated, and configured onto a provider-viewable dashboard.

EVALUATION: Wireless monitoring of mobility after major surgery was easy and practical. There was a significant relationship between the number of steps taken in the early recovery period, length of stay, and dismissal disposition.

CONCLUSIONS: Wireless monitoring of mobility after major surgery creates an opportunity for early identification and intervention in individual patients and could serve as a tool to evaluate and improve the process of care and to affect postdischarge outcomes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of a variety of Actical accelerometer count thresholds for determining sitting time in a sample of office workers. METHODS: Data were collected from 21 participants in Auckland, New Zealand, between December 2009 and January 2010. Participants wore a hip-mounted Actical accelerometer and thigh-mounted activPAL inclinometer (criterion) for a 48-h period. Raw inclinometer and accelerometer data for each 15s epoch of wear time were matched by date and time. Candidate accelerometer count thresholds for sitting classification were compared with the criterion measure using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Agreement in sitting time classification was determined using Bland-Altman methodology. RESULTS: Significant differences in area under the curve (AUC) values by threshold criteria were found (p<0.001). A threshold of 0 counts provided the highest combined sensitivity and specificity (AUC 0.759, 95{\%}CI 0.756, 0.761). The 95{\%} limits of agreement for time spent sitting were wide, at 328min (range -30.8, 297.5). CONCLUSION: A threshold of 0 counts/15s epoch with Actical accelerometers is likely to yield the most accurate quantification of sitting in office-based workers, however the wide limits of agreement found indicate limited utility of this threshold to accurately distinguish sitting time in office-based workers.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: It has been suggested that health benefits from physical activity may be accrued through active commuting to school. Considering that active commuting is modifiable via policy and that there is limited research examining active commuting among high school students, this is a domain that warrants further investigation. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationships between demographic, behavioral, social/psychological, and environmental correlates of active commuting to school among a sample of high school students. METHODS: Students (N = 21,345) from 76 Ontario high schools (grades 9-12) completed the School Health Action, Planning and Evaluation System Physical Activity Module between 2005-2006. Demographic (gender, grade, body mass index), behavioral (smoking status, physical activity, sedentary time), social/psychological (perceived athletic ability, weight status, parental encouragement), and environmental (school location, type, weather) predictors of active commuting (daily or mixed mode) were assessed. RESULTS: Only 42.5{\%} of high school students reported actively commuting to school. Students were less likely to actively commute to school if they were girls, in grade 12, smoked daily, were low-moderate in physical activity, or attended a rural school. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of active commuting to school are influenced by multiple factors, some of which are modifiable through intervention. This has important implications for future school-based programming designed to enhance health and physical activity of adolescents through using active modes of transportation to school.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although adverse health outcomes are increased among children with BMI above the 85th (overweight) and 95th (obese) percentiles, previous studies have not clearly defined the BMI percentile at which adverse health outcomes begin to increase. We examined whether the existing BMI percentile cutoffs are optimal for defining increased risk for dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, and hypertension. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2001 to 2006. Studied were 8216 children aged 6 to 17 years, representative of the US population. BMI was calculated by using measured height and weight and converted to percentiles for age in months and gender. Outcome measures (dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, and hypertension) were based on laboratory and physical examination results; these were analyzed as both continuous and categorical outcomes. RESULTS: Significant increases for total cholesterol values and prevalence of abnormal cholesterol begin at the 80th percentile. Significant increases in glycohemoglobin values and prevalence of abnormal values begin at the 99th percentile. Consistent significant increases in the prevalence of high or borderline systolic blood pressure begin at the 90th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: Intervening for overweight children and their health requires clinical interventions that target the right children. On the basis of our data, a judicious approach to screening could include consideration of lipid screening for children beginning at the 80th percentile but for dysglycemia at the 99th percentile. Current definitions of overweight and obese may be more useful for general recognition of potential health problems and discussions with parents and children about the need to address childhood obesity.},

The goal of this study was to review available evidence pertaining to performance of activity trackers. A comprehensive review of available information has been conducted for seven representative devices and the validity of marketing claims was assessed. The device assessment was based on availability of verified output metrics, theoretical frameworks, systematic evaluation, and FDA clearance. The review identified critical absence of supporting evidence of advertised functions and benefits for the majority of the devices. Six out of seven devices did not provide any information on sensor accuracy and output validity at all. Possible underestimation or overestimation of specific health indicators reported to consumers was not clearly disclosed to the public. Furthermore, significant limitations of these devices which can be categorized into user restrictions, user responsibilities and company disclaimers could not be easily found or comprehended by unsophisticated users and may represent a serious health hazard.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Psychosocial and health behaviour treatments and therapies can be extended beyond traditional research or clinical settings by using mobile technology to deliver interventions to individuals as they go about their daily lives. These ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are treatments that are provided to people during their everyday lives (i.e. in real time) and in natural settings (i.e. real world). The goal of the present review is to synthesize and critique mobile technology-based EMI aimed at improving health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms. METHODS: Twenty-seven interventions using palmtop computers or mobile phones to deliver ambulatory treatment for smoking cessation, weight loss, anxiety, diabetes management, eating disorders, alcohol use, and healthy eating and physical activity were identified. RESULTS: There is evidence that EMI can be successfully delivered, are accepted by patients, and are efficacious for treating a variety of health behaviours and physical and psychological symptoms. Limitations of the existing literature were identified and recommendations and considerations for research design, sample characteristics, measurement, statistical analyses, and clinical implementation are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile technology-based EMI can be effectively implemented as interventions for a variety of health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms. Future research should integrate the assessment and intervention capabilities of mobile technology to create dynamically and individually tailored EMI that are ecologically sensitive.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While there are increasing data implicating poor recognition of physical inactivity as a potential barrier to healthy behaviour change, the efficacy of feedback to promote physical activity is uncertain. Using a randomised controlled trial nested within a population-based cohort study, we plan to test three variations of physical activity feedback against a control group. Our primary objective is to assess the efficacy of physical activity feedback in promoting physical activity behaviour change. Secondary objectives are to determine the influence of feedback on physical activity awareness and cognitions, and to compare behavioural effects by type of feedback. METHODS/DESIGN: We aim to recruit 500 healthy participants aged 30 to 55 years from the ongoing Fenland Study (Cambridge, UK). Following careful phenotyping during baseline measurement (anthropometric, clinical, body composition and fitness measurements, as well as questionnaires assessing self-reported and self-rated physical activity, psychosocial correlates of physical activity behaviour, diet, lifestyle and general health), participants wear a combined heart rate and movement sensor (Actiheart(R)) for six continuous days and nights. After receipt of the physical activity data (around 2 weeks later), participants are randomly allocated to either a control group (no feedback) or one of three types of personalised physical activity feedback ('simple', 'visualised' or 'contextualised'), and complete repeat measures of self-rated physical activity and psychosocial correlates. Approximately five weeks after receiving feedback, all participants wear the Actiheart(R) for another six-day follow-up period and complete repeat questionnaires. Values at outcome, adjusted for baseline, will be compared between randomised groups. DISCUSSION: Given the randomised trial design and use of objective measure of physical activity, this study is likely to provide valuable insights into the efficacy of a feedback intervention in changing physical activity behaviour, as well as the psychological mechanisms involved.

abstract = {The inferred cost of work-related stress call for early prevention strategies. In this, we see a new opportunity for affective and pervasive computing by detecting early warning signs. This paper goes one step toward this goal. A collective of 33 subjects underwent a laboratory stress intervention, while a set of physiological signals was collected. In this paper, we investigate whether affective information related to stress can be found in the posture channel during office work. Following more recent work in this field, we directly associate features that are derived from the pressure distribution on a chair with affective states. We found that nervous subjects reveal higher variance of movements under stress. Furthermore, we show that a person-independent discrimination of stress from cognitive load is feasible when using pressure data only. A supervised variant of a self-organizing map, which is able to adapt to different patterns of stress responses, reaches an overall accuracy of 73.75{\%} with unknown subjects.},

Methods Eighteen full-time employees (mean age+SD 40.2+10.7 years; 88{\%} female) working in sedentary occupations were recruited for participation. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected at baseline and 4 weeks. Participants were provided access to a pedal exercise machine for 4 weeks at work.

At 4 weeks, participants completed a feasibility questionnaire. Results Participants reported sitting 83{\%} of their working days. Participants used the pedal machines an average of 12.2+6.6 out of a possible 20 working days and pedalled an average of 23.4+20.4 min each day used. Feasibility data indicate that participants found the machines feasible for use at work. Participants also reported sedentary time at work decreased due to the machine. Discussion Findings from this study suggest that this pedal machine may be a feasible tool for reducing sedentary time while at work. These findings hold public health significance due to the growing number of sedentary jobs in the USA and the potential of the device for use in large-scale worksite health programmes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the use of standing 'hot' desks in an open plan office and their impact on sedentary work time. METHOD: Australian employees (n=11; 46.9 [9.8] years; BMI 25.9 [3.5kg/m(2)]) wore an armband accelerometer for two consecutive working weeks (November-December 2010). In the second week, employees were encouraged to use a pod of four standing 'hot' desks to stand and work as often as possible. Desk use was recorded using time logs. The percentages of daily work time spent in sedentary (<1.6 METs), light (1.6-3.0 METs) and moderate+ (>3 METs) intensity categories were calculated for each week, relative to the total daily time at work. Paired sample t tests were used to compare weekly differences. RESULTS: Employees spent 8:09±0:31h/day at work and 'hot' desk use ranged from zero to 9:35h for the week. There were no significant changes in mean time spent in sedentary (difference of -0.1{\%}), light (difference of 0.8{\%}) and moderate+ (-0.7{\%}) intensity categories. However, individual changes in sedentary work time ranged from -5.9 to 6.4{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Volitional use of standing 'hot' desks varied and while individual changes were apparent, desk use did not alter overall sedentary work time in this sample.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing levels of physical inactivity and sedentariness are contributing to the current overweight and obesity epidemic. In this paper, the findings of two recent studies are used to explore the relationships between sitting time (in transport, work and leisure), physical activity and body mass index (BMI) in two contrasting samples of adult Australians. METHODS: Data on sitting time, physical activity, BMI and a number of demographic characteristics were compared for participants in two studies-529 women who were participants in a preschool health promotion project ('mothers'), and 185 men and women who were involved in a workplace pedometer study ('workers'). Relationships between age, number of children, physical activity, sitting time, BMI, gender and work patterns were explored. Logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of being overweight or obese, among participants with different physical activity, sitting time and work patterns. RESULTS: The total reported time spent sitting per day (across all domains) was almost 6 h less among the mothers than the workers (P<0.001), and compared with the mothers, a significantly greater proportion of the workers was classified as overweight or obese (BMI > or =25 kg/m(2)). Univariate analysis found that, compared with men in full-time work, women who worked full-time (OR=0.42, CI: 0.24-0.74), part-time (OR=0.35, CI: 0.20-0.59) or in full-time home duties (OR=0.51, CI: 0.29-0.88) were about half as likely to be overweight or obese. Participants who reported high daily levels of sitting (> or =7.4 h) were also significantly more likely than those who reported 'low' levels (<4.7 h/day) to be overweight or obese (OR=1.68, CI: 1.16-2.42). Multivariate analysis (including physical activity, work patterns and sitting time) confirmed that full-time and part-time working women (but not 'home duties' women) were less likely to report BMI > or =25 kg/m(2) than full-time working men (full-time: OR=0.44, CI: 0.25-0.78; part-time: OR=0.45, CI: 0.24-0.86), but the OR for BMI > or =25 among those in the high sitting category was attenuated (OR=1.61, CI 0.96-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a need for inclusion of measures of both activity and inactivity in future studies, so that the complex relationships between these behavioural determinants of BMI can be clarified.},

DESIGN: Observational epidemiological study. SUBJECTS: One thousand forty eight working adults. Using a multistage sampling design on neighbourhood SES, participants were from high and low SES neighbourhoods of an Australian capital city. MEASUREMENTS: Neighbourhood SES was assessed using census data; individual SES was based on self-reported educational attainment and household income. There were three sitting time variables: sitting time on weekdays, weekend days and in leisure time. Overweight and obesity were determined using self-reported body weight and height. RESULTS: Gender, age, neighbourhood SES, education, working hours and physical activity were independently associated with weekday, weekend day and leisure-related sitting time. With the exception of education and working hours, these variables were also independently associated with being overweight or obese. Leisure-time sitting was found to be a mediator in the relationships between gender, education and being overweight or obese. CONCLUSION: Strategies to promote less sitting in leisure time are required to combat overweight and obesity in Australian adults, especially among those from low SES neighbourhoods, and among those with high levels of education and income who work long hours.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The prevalence of obesity increased in the United States between 1976-1980 and 1988-1994 and again between 1988-1994 and 1999-2000. OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in obesity from 1999 through 2008 and the current prevalence of obesity and overweight for 2007-2008. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of height and weight measurements from 5555 adult men and women aged 20 years or older obtained in 2007-2008 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative sample of the US population. Data from the NHANES obtained in 2007-2008 were compared with results obtained from 1999 through 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimates of the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adults. Overweight was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 29.9. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher. RESULTS: In 2007-2008, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity was 33.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 31.6{\%}-36.0{\%}) overall, 32.2{\%} (95{\%} CI, 29.5{\%}-35.0{\%}) among men, and 35.5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 33.2{\%}-37.7{\%}) among women. The corresponding prevalence estimates for overweight and obesity combined (BMI > or = 25) were 68.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 66.3{\%}-69.8{\%}), 72.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 70.4{\%}-74.1{\%}), and 64.1{\%} (95{\%} CI, 61.3{\%}-66.9{\%}). Obesity prevalence varied by age group and by racial and ethnic group for both men and women. Over the 10-year period, obesity showed no significant trend among women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.12 [95{\%} CI, 0.89-1.32]). For men, there was a significant linear trend (AOR for 2007-2008 vs 1999-2000, 1.32 [95{\%} CI, 1.12-1.58]); however, the 3 most recent data points did not differ significantly from each other. CONCLUSIONS: In 2007-2008, the prevalence of obesity was 32.2{\%} among adult men and 35.5{\%} among adult women. The increases in the prevalence of obesity previously observed do not appear to be continuing at the same rate over the past 10 years, particularly for women and possibly for men.},

The system presents the user's physical activity counts at real time to remind how much daily activity is needed to keep healthy. The user takes pictures of food items and the system provides health related information regarding to the food item intakes. The system is composed of an on-device database which holds the user specific data and food item information. HealthAware is a real time practical system to prevent obesity by enhancing individual daily healthy behavior awareness.},

abstract = {Overweight and obesity are a global epidemic, with over one billion overweight adults worldwide (300+ million of whom are obese). Obesity is linked to several serious health problems and medical conditions. Medical experts agree that physical activity is critical to maintaining fitness, reducing weight, and improving health, yet many people have difficulty increasing and maintaining physical activity in everyday life. Clinical studies have shown that health benefits can occur from simply increasing the number of steps one takes each day and that social support can motivate people to stay active. In this paper, we describe Houston, a prototype mobile phone application for encouraging activity by sharing step count with friends. We also present four design requirements for technologies that encourage physical activity that we derived from a three-week long in situ pilot study that was conducted with women who wanted to increase their physical activity.},

They present 4 design requirement for technologies that encourage PA derived from 3-week long in situ pilot study that was conducted with women who wanted to inc their PA.
All participants were female, groups of 4-5 friends. All wanted to inc PA, prevent WG, and lose some weight. 

Goal: To encourage Opportunistic PA, {\&}amp; structured exercise
Question: Can technology encourage PA by providing personal awareness of activity level and mediating physical activity-related social interaction among friends. 
4 design requirements for this space: 
1. Give users proper credit for activities
2. provide personal awareness of activity level (not sure what this means?)
3. Support social influence (good for SMART)
4. Consider practical constraints of users' lifestyles.

Houston: SW fitness journal, track {\&}amp; share progress toward a daily step count goal within a small group of friends. Three versions: baseline, personal, {\&}amp; sharing. 

Results: sharing groups were significantly more likely to meet their goal
Support of Social Influence: social pressure, soc support, and communication.
Soc Support: participants enjoyed receiving recognition from friends.

Issue to be resolved: how to set the goals personal vs. group?

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efforts to achieve population-wide increases in walking and similar moderate-intensity physical activities potentially can be enhanced through relevant applications of state-of-the-art interactive communication technologies. Yet few systematic efforts to evaluate the efficacy of hand-held computers and similar devices for enhancing physical activity levels have occurred. The purpose of this first-generation study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant [PDA]) for increasing moderate intensity or more vigorous (MOD+) physical activity levels over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults relative to a standard information control arm. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled 8-week experiment. Data were collected in 2005 and analyzed in 2006-2007. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Community-based study of 37 healthy, initially underactive adults aged 50 years and older who were randomized and completed the 8-week study (intervention=19, control=18). INTERVENTION: Participants received an instructional session and a PDA programmed to monitor their physical activity levels twice per day and provide daily and weekly individualized feedback, goal setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate written physical activity educational materials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Physical activity was assessed via the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater 8-week mean estimated caloric expenditure levels and minutes per week in MOD+ activity (p<0.04). Satisfaction with the PDA was reasonably high in this largely PDA-naive sample. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this first-generation study indicate that hand-held computers may be effective tools for increasing initial physical activity levels among underactive adults.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolving concepts of pervasive computing, ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence are increasingly influencing health care and medicine. Summarizing published research, this literature review provides an overview of recent developments and implementations of pervasive computing systems in health care. It also highlights some of the experiences reported in deployment processes. METHODS: There is no clear definition of pervasive computing in the current literature. Thus specific inclusion criteria for selecting articles about relevant systems were developed. Searches were conducted in four scientific databases alongside manual journal searches for the period of 2002 to 2006. Articles included present prototypes, case studies and pilot studies, clinical trials and systems that are already in routine use. RESULTS: The searches identified 69 articles describing 67 different systems. In a quantitative analysis, these systems were categorized into project status, health care settings, user groups, improvement aims, and systems features (i.e., component types, data gathering, data transmission, systems functions). The focus is on the types of systems implemented, their frequency of occurrence and their characteristics. Qualitative analyses were performed of deployment issues, such as organizational and personnel issues, privacy and security issues, and financial issues. This paper provides a comprehensive access to the literature of the emerging field by addressing specific topics of application settings, systems features, and deployment experiences. CONCLUSION: Both an overview and an analysis of the literature on a broad and heterogeneous range of systems are provided. Most systems are described in their prototype stages. Deployment issues, such as implications on organization or personnel, privacy concerns, or financial issues are mentioned rarely, though their solution is regarded as decisive in transferring promising systems to a stage of regular operation. There is a need for further research on the deployment of pervasive computing systems, including clinical studies, economic and social analyses, user studies, etc.},

abstract = {Aims Prolonged sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed economies and is associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile and premature mortality. This study examined the associations of objectively assessed sedentary time and breaks (interruptions) in sedentary time with continuous cardio-metabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers, and whether these associations varied by sex, age, and/or race/ethnicity. Methods and results Cross-sectional analyses with 4757 participants (≥20 years) from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An Actigraph accelerometer was used to derive sedentary time [<100 counts per minute (cpm)] and breaks in sedentary time. Independent of potential confounders, including moderate-to-vigorous exercise, detrimental linear associations (P for trends <0.05) of sedentary time with waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-{\%}B, and HOMA-{\%}S were observed. Independent of potential confounders and sedentary time, breaks were beneficially associated with waist circumference and C-reactive protein (P for trends <0.05). There was limited evidence of meaningful differences in associations with biomarkers by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Notable exceptions were sex-differences in the associations of sedentary time and breaks with HDL-cholesterol, and race/ethnicity differences in the association of sedentary time with waist circumference with associations detrimental in non-Hispanic whites, null in Mexican Americans, and beneficial in non-Hispanic blacks. Conclusion These are the first population-representative findings on the deleterious associations of prolonged sedentary time with cardio-metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. The findings suggest that clinical communications and preventive health messages on reducing and breaking up sedentary time may be beneficial for cardiovascular disease risk.},

This systematic review provides an overview of behavior change interventions for disease management and prevention delivered through text messaging. Evidence on behavior change and clinical outcomes was compiled from randomized or quasi-experimental controlled trials of text message interventions published in peer-reviewed journals by June 2009. Only those interventions using text message as the primary mode of communication were included. Study quality was assessed by using a standardized measure. Seventeen articles representing 12 studies (5 disease prevention and 7 disease management) were included. Intervention length ranged from 3 months to 12 months, none had long-term follow-up, and message frequency varied. Of 9 sufficiently powered studies, 8 found evidence to support text messaging as a tool for behavior change. Effects exist across age, minority status, and nationality. Nine countries are represented in this review, but it is problematic that only one is a developing country, given potential benefits of such a widely accessible, relatively inexpensive tool for health behavior change.

This book reflects the findings of the conference and discusses the state of the science of real-time data capture and its application to health and cancer research. It provides a conceptual framework for minute-by-minute data capture- ecological momentary assessments (EMA)- and discusses health-related topics where these assessements have been applied. In addition, future directions in real-time data capture assessment, interventions, methodology, and technology are discussed. Despite the rapidly growing interest in the methodology of real-time data capture (e.g. journal special issues, widely attended conference presentations, etc.), to date no single book has focused solely on this topic.

Designed a study to investigate the dependency of the eWatch classification accruacy on given different pody positions: belt, shirt pocket, trouser pocket, backpack, and neckalce. 
The results of the study would help decide on the best position to palce such a sensor platform, and understand the nature of the trade-off between wearing position and classification performance. 

6 subjects, each subject performed given tasks in 45 to 50 min. Total collected 290 min of sesor data

Classification: compare Decision Trees, k-nearest neighbot, Naive-B.
Decision Tress and Naive-Bayes were found to achieve high recognition accuracy. 
Decision Tree good balance between accuracy and computational complexity. 
Using F6 classifier that data indicates that any of the 6 positions are good for detecting walking, standing, sitting, and running. 
Ascending and descending the stairs is difficult to distinguish from walking in all positions.
The wrist performs best bc the features set was optimitzed for the wrist position. 
6. Onboard activity classifier
Designed a decision tree classifier that runs on the eWatch. Feature F6 was used to build the decision tree. 
They used the wrist one during the day.},

Worksite interventions designed to decrease sedentary time may serve to improve employee health. Objective The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and use of a pedal exercise machine for reducing workplace sedentary time. Methods Eighteen full-time employees (mean age+SD 40.2+10.7 years; 88{\%} female) working in sedentary occupations were recruited for participation. Demographic and anthropometric data were collected at baseline and 4 weeks. Participants were provided access to a pedal exercise machine for 4 weeks at work. Use of the device was measured objectively by exercise tracking software, which monitors pedal activity and provides the user real-time feedback (eg, speed, time, distance, calories). At 4 weeks, participants completed a feasibility questionnaire. Results Participants reported sitting 83{\%} of their working days. Participants used the pedal machines an average of 12.2+6.6 out of a possible 20 working days and pedalled an average of 23.4+20.4 min each day used. Feasibility data indicate that participants found the machines feasible for use at work. Participants also reported sedentary time at work decreased due to the machine. Discussion Findings from this study suggest that this pedal machine may be a feasible tool for reducing sedentary time while at work. These findings hold public health significance due to the growing number of sedentary jobs in the USA and the potential of the device for use in large-scale worksite health programmes.},

Quantification of the processes that lead to a post-human state is key to the optimisation, scaling, distribution of post-human development. 

By making abstract and qualitative claims about post-humanism this fundamentally hinders progress to a post-human state and may lead to state changes that do not progress us towards a post-human state or particular post-human state of interest.

Quantified self and self-tracking methods and tools that utilise big data and personalised analytics show promise for performing experiments that lead to a post-human state. In addition, quantified self and self-tracking methods allow for states and qualities previously and widely considered qualitative to be quantified. States such as emotional states, elegance of form, brain states, interpersonal interaction and lifestyles can now, for some parameters, be measured quantitatively. 

By outlining clear milestones to reach and a mutual goal of achieving post-humanity this would allow focused work to optimise systems and innovate to reach a shared target. Quantification of ourselves and environments with self-tracking technologies and ubiquitous computing we can both see what processes, objects and states lead to characteristics we ascribe to the post-human, use the data for biofeedback and education, and engineer post-human futures.

A preliminary, longitudinal self-tracking project has been undertaken to track individual post-human development and the processes, objects or entities that may lead to post-human states. The proof-of-principle experiment tracks multi-level changes on the molecular, behavourial, cognitive, social, material and psychological level as an attempt is made to reach a post-human state with particular quantitative criteria. In this study the individual is attempting to achieve post-humanity as an intermediate state, with the core goal being an infinite lifespan through a systematic and comprehensive re-engineering of the self and universe.

The primary creation of the longitudinal project was a database of categorised  processes, states and objects that may lead us towards or away from an infinite post-human existence. This may be the first categorised database of its kind that seeks to catalog processes, states and objects that we could enrich for or remove from existence in order to attain an infinite post-human existence. This cataloging will enable milestones to be created, experiments to be performed, actions to be quantified and goals to be reached. 

By self-tracking and biofeedback the individual can modify their thoughts and behaviour in order to assist the development of post-human states. Self-tracking also allows sharing knowledge on how to develop into a post-human, and utilization of crowdsourcing becoming post-human. 

During the proof-of-principle experiment multiple other potentially quantifiable processes were uncovered that could be tracked via self-tracking technologies and big data such as totals and growth of peaceful entities, global loss of negative human morphological and behavioural traits, tracking and removal of non-aesthetic items that are not conducive to longevity and the post-human state.

abstract = {Socio-cultural markers such as attitudes, behaviours, ideas, aspirations and interests were collected and correlated to previously identified social, psychological and quantitative predictors of lifespan. Attitudes to whether a person wanted to live for as long as possible and if so in what condition were also surveyed. The aim of the study was to identify trends, correlations and multivariate, interdisciplinary markers of health that contain word and phrase based socio-cultural markers as well as other known longevity markers. This would lead to enhanced accuracy in predictions of current health states and longevity predictions. Text-data analysis was chosen to find novel longevity markers, as text-data is easily surveyed, available, digitized and sequence-based. As more than an analogy to The Human Genome Project, The Human Memome Project sets out to record personalised text-sequence data for individuals to be able to correlate particular text-sequences to specific health markers associated with longevity. Data was gathered from over 300 participants, 25 countries, 6 continents, in an 18-70-age range. We have attempted to use varied statistical analysis and computational modeling techniques to build optimal sets of attitudes, behaviours and interests that correlate the most with longevity and find text-sequences that are correlated the most or least with longevity. This project presents a proof-of-principle experiment that could be developed into advanced technology platforms, big data analysis, predictive analytics and personal health tools for the healthcare, preventative medicine and global, local or personal, real-time longevity risk analysis. The Human Memome Project also presents a key engagement with the Crowd Sourcing, Citizen Science and Quantified Self communities for research into longevity.},

abstract = {Little is known about how to generate plausible new scientific ideas. So it is noteworthy that 12 years of self-experimentation led to the discovery of several surprising cause-effect relationships and suggested a new theory of weight control, an unusually high rate of new ideas. The cause-effect relationships were: (1) Seeing faces in the morning on television decreased mood in the evening (> 10 hrs later) and improved mood the next day (> 24 hrs later), yet had no detectable effect before that (0-10 hrs later). The effect was strongest if the faces were life-sized and at a conversational distance. Travel across time zones reduced the effect for a few weeks. (2) Standing 8 hours per day reduced early awakening and made sleep more restorative, even though more standing was associated with less sleep. (3) Morning light (1 hr/day) reduced early awakening and made sleep more restorative. (4) Breakfast increased early awakening. (5) Standing and morning light together eliminated colds (upper respiratory tract infections) for more than 5 years. (6) Drinking lots of water, eating low-glycemic-index foods, and eating sushi each caused a modest weight loss. (7) Drinking unflavored fructose water caused a large weight loss that has lasted more than 1 year. While losing weight, hunger was much less than usual. Unflavored sucrose water had a similar effect. The new theory of weight control, which helped discover this effect, assumes that flavors associated with calories raise the body-fat set point: The stronger the association, the greater the increase. Between meals the set point declines. Self-experimentation lasting months or years seems to be a good way to generate plausible new ideas.},

abstract = {Healthcare managers, clinical researchers and individual patients (and their physicians) manage variation differently to achieve different ends. First, managers are primarily concerned with the performance of care processes over time. Their time horizon is relatively short, and the improvements they are concerned with are pragmatic and 'holistic.' Their goal is to create processes that are stable and effective. The analytical techniques of statistical process control effectively reflect these concerns. Second, clinical and health-services researchers are interested in the effectiveness of care and the generalisability of findings. They seek to control variation by their study design methods. Their primary question is: 'Does A cause B, everything else being equal?' Consequently, randomised controlled trials and regression models are the research methods of choice. The focus of this reductionist approach is on the 'average patient' in the group being observed rather than the individual patient working with the individual care provider. Third, individual patients are primarily concerned with the nature and quality of their own care and clinical outcomes. They and their care providers are not primarily seeking to generalise beyond the unique individual. We propose that the gold standard for helping individual patients with chronic conditions should be longitudinal factorial design of trials with individual patients. Understanding how these three groups deal differently with variation can help appreciate these three approaches.},

These common risk behaviors cause preventable, delayed illness that then manifests as chronic disease, requiring extended medical care with associated financial costs. Chronic disease already accounts for 75{\%} of U.S. health-care costs, foreshadowing an unsustainable financial burden for the aging population [1]. We are facing an urgent need to re-engineer health systems to improve public health through behavior change, and technology-supported behavioral change interventions will be a part of 21st-century health care.

Integrated high-throughput omics studies enable multifaceted views of cells, organisms, or their communities. With the advent of new post-genomics technologies, omics studies are becoming increasingly prevalent; yet the full impact of these studies can only be realized through data harmonization, sharing, meta-analysis, and integrated research. These essential steps require consistent generation, capture, and distribution of metadata. To ensure transparency, facilitate data harmonization, and maximize reproducibility and usability of life sciences studies, we propose a simple common omics metadata checklist. The proposed checklist is built on the rich ontologies and standards already in use by the life sciences community. The checklist will serve as a common denominator to guide experimental design, capture important parameters, and be used as a standard format for stand-alone data publications. The omics metadata checklist and data publications will create efficient linkages between omics data and knowledge-based life sciences innovation and, importantly, allow for appropriate attribution to data generators and infrastructure science builders in the post-genomics era. We ask that the life sciences community test the proposed omics metadata checklist and data publications and provide feedback for their use and improvement.},

abstract = {Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are web-based and mobile interventions intended to support patients and consumers in changing behaviors related to health, mental health, and well-being. BITs are provided to patients and consumers in clinical care settings and commercial marketplaces, frequently with little or no evaluation. Current evaluation methods, including RCTs and implementation studies, can require years to validate an intervention. This timeline is fundamentally incompatible with the BIT environment, where technology advancement and changes in consumer expectations occur quickly, necessitating rapidly evolving interventions. However, BITs can routinely and iteratively collect data in a planned and strategic manner and generate evidence through systematic prospective analyses, thereby creating a system that can "learn." A methodologic framework, Continuous Evaluation of Evolving Behavioral Intervention Technologies (CEEBIT), is proposed that can support the evaluation of multiple BITs or evolving versions, eliminating those that demonstrate poorer outcomes, while allowing new BITs to be entered at any time. CEEBIT could be used to ensure the effectiveness of BITs provided through deployment platforms in clinical care organizations or BIT marketplaces. The features of CEEBIT are described, including criteria for the determination of inferiority, determination of BIT inclusion, methods of assigning consumers to BITs, definition of outcomes, and evaluation of the usefulness of the system. CEEBIT offers the potential to collapse initial evaluation and postmarketing surveillance, providing ongoing assurance of safety and efficacy to patients and consumers, payers, and policymakers.},

@article{Akar2013a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend using remote patient monitoring (RPM) for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, but the patterns of adoption of this technology have not been described. Successful use of RPM depends on (1) the enrollment of the patient into an RPM system and (2) subsequent activation of RPM by the enrolled patient. We examined RPM enrollment and activation rates and the patient, physician, and institutional determinants of RPM use.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Information about the use of RPM-capable devices was obtained from the Boston Scientific Corporation ALTITUDE program and linked to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry. Patients were first categorized as RPM-enrolled and RPM-not enrolled, and the RPM-enrolled patients were further categorized into RPM-active and RPM-inactive groups based on whether they transmitted RPM data. Variables associated with RPM enrollment and activation were identified with the use of multivariable logistic regression. Among 39 158 patients with newly implanted RPM-capable devices, 62{\%} (n=24 113) were RPM-enrolled. Of those enrolled, 76{\%} (n=18 289, or 47{\%} of the entire cohort) activated their device. RPM enrollment was highly variable among institutions. The hospital-specific median odds ratio for RPM enrollment was 3.43, signifying that physician or institutional factors are associated with RPM enrollment. In contrast, the hospital-specific median odds ratio for RPM activation was 1.69. Age, race, health insurance, geographic location, and health-related factors were similarly associated with both RPM enrollment and activation.

CONCLUSIONS: RPM technology is used in less than half of eligible patients. Lack of enrollment into RPM systems is the major cause of underutilization, and this primarily relates to the local practice environment.},

abstract = {Data on health and wellness from around the world reveal a pattern of less than optimal outcomes for the young and old alike. These results are not limited to the developing world. In fact, a recent report showed that Americans die sooner and experience higher rates of disease and injury than people in other high-income countries [1]. Although the precise causes of these disparities are not fully elucidated, chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease, are increasing in the Western world. Similarly, in the low- and middle-income countries, chronic disease is increasingly being cited as an emerging problem and a major component of disease burden [2]. It is widely suspected that the increased prevalence of unhealthy behaviors plays a significant role in overall health and in chronic disease. Indeed, it has been estimated that approximately 40{\%} of all premature deaths are due to behavioral patterns that are potentially modifiable [3]. Further, in patients suffering from chronic disease, self-management of health behaviors (e.g., eating well, exercising as indicated, and taking medication as directed) has been shown to have a significant effect on symptom reduction and quality of life, as well as reducing costs in the health-care system [4]. Finally, enhancing health behavior to prevent disease has been consistently shown to decrease adverse health events over time. Thus, the dangerous effects of inactivity, poor diet, smoking, drug and alcohol use, lack of sleep, and chronically stressful environments are now widely appreciated to be associated with not only the quality of life but also with mortality and health-care and disability costs.},

abstract = {The weight scale is perhaps the most ubiquitous health sensor of all and is important to many health and lifestyle decisions, but its fundamental interface--a single numerical estimate of a person's current weight--has remained largely unchanged for 100 years. An opportunity exists to impact public health by re-considering this pervasive interface. Toward that end, we investigated the correspondence between consumers' perceptions of weight data and the realities of weight fluctuation. Through an analysis of online product reviews, a journaling study on weight fluctuations, expert interviews, and a large-scale survey of scale users, we found that consumers' perception of weight scale behavior is often disconnected from scales' capabilities and from clinical relevance, and that accurate understanding of weight fluctuation is associated with greater trust in the scale itself. We propose significant changes to how weight data should be presented and discuss broader implications for the design of other ubiquitous health sensing devices.},

abstract = {Various innovative chemical sensors have been developed in recent years to sense dangerous substances in air and trace biomarkers in breath. However, in order to solve real world problems, the sensors must be equipped with efficient sample conditioning that can, e.g., control the humidity, which is discussed much less in the literature. To meet the demand, a miniaturized mouthpiece was developed for personal breath analyzers. A key function of the mouthpiece is to condition the humidity in real breath samples without changing the analyte concentrations and introducing substantial backpressure, which is achieved with optimized packing of desiccant particles. Numerical simulations were carried out to determine the performance of the mouthpiece in terms of various controllable parameters, such as the size, density, and geometry of the packing. Mouthpieces with different configurations were built and tested, and the experimental data validated the simulation findings. A mouthpiece with optimized performance reducing relative humidity from 95{\%} (27,000 ppmV) to 29{\%} (8000 ppmV) whereas retaining 92{\%} nitric oxide (50 ppbV to 46 ppbV) was built and integrated into a hand-held exhaled nitric oxide sensor, and the performance of exhaled nitric oxide measurement was in good agreement with the gold standard chemiluminescence technique. Acetone, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and ammonia samples were also measured after passing through the desiccant mouthpiece using commercial sensors to examine wide applicability of this breath conditioning approach.},

abstract = {Our current health research enterprise is painstakingly slow and cumbersome, and its results seldom translate into practice. The slow pace of health research contributes to findings that are less relevant and potentially even obsolete. To produce more rapid, responsive, and relevant research, we propose approaches that increase relevance via greater stakeholder involvement, speed research via innovative designs, streamline review processes, and create and/or better leverage research infrastructure. Broad stakeholder input integrated throughout the research process can both increase relevance and facilitate study procedures. More flexible and rapid research designs should be considered before defaulting to the traditional two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), but even traditional RCTs can be designed for more rapid findings. Review processes for grant applications, IRB protocols, and manuscript submissions can be better streamlined to minimize delays. Research infrastructures such as rapid learning systems and other health information technologies can be leveraged to rapidly evaluate new and existing treatments, and alleviate the extensive recruitment delays common in traditional research. These and other approaches are feasible but require a culture shift among the research community to value not only methodological rigor, but also the pace and relevance of research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Self-management of risk behaviors is a cornerstone of future population health interventions. Using mobile phones for routine self-monitoring and feedback is a cost-efficient strategy for self-management and ecological momentary interventions (EMI). However, mobile health applications need to be designed to be highly attractive and acceptable to a broad range of user groups. To inform the design of an adaptable mobile health application we aimed to identify the dimensions and range of user preferences for application features by different user groups.

METHODS: Five focus group interviews were conducted: two (n=9; n=20) with people living with HIV (PLH) and three with young mothers (n=6; n=8; n=10). Thematic analyses were conducted on the focus group sessions' notes and transcripts.

RESULTS: Both groups considered customization of reminders and prompts as necessary, and goal setting, motivational messaging, problem solving, and feedback as attractive. For PLH, automated and location-based reminders for medication adherence and sharing data with healthcare providers were both acceptable and attractive features. Privacy protection and invasiveness were the primary concerns, particularly around location tracking, illegal drug use, and sexual partner information. Concerns were ameliorated by use scenario or purpose, monetary incentives, and password protection. Privacy was not a major concern to mothers who considered passwords burdensome. Mothers' preferences focused on customization that supports mood, exercise and eating patterns, and especially using the mobile phone camera to photograph food to increase self-accountability.

CONCLUSIONS: Individualization emerged as the key feature and design principle to reduce user burden and increase attractiveness and acceptability. Mobile phone EMI uniquely enables individualization, context-aware and real-time feedback, and tailored intervention delivery.},

abstract = {We are in the midst of what some have called a "mobile health revolution". Medical applications ("apps") for mobile phones are proliferating in the marketplace and clinicians are likely encountering patients with questions about the medical value of these apps. We conducted a review of medical apps focused on endocrine disease. We found a higher percentage of relevant apps in our searches of the iPhone app store compared with the Android marketplace. For our diabetes search in the iPhone store, the majority of apps (33{\%}) focused on health tracking (blood sugars, insulin doses, carbohydrates), requiring manual entry of health data. Only two apps directly inputted blood sugars from glucometers attached to the mobile phone. The remainder of diabetes apps were teaching/training apps (22{\%}), food reference databases (8{\%}), social blogs/forums (5{\%}), and physician directed apps (8{\%}). We found a number of insulin dose calculator apps which technically meet criteria for being a medically regulated mobile application, but did not find evidence for FDA-approval despite their availability to consumers. Far fewer apps were focused on other endocrine disease and included medical reference for the field of endocrinology, access to endocrine journals, height predictors, medication trackers, and fertility apps. Although mobile health apps have great potential for improving chronic disease care, they face a number of challenges including lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness, lack of integration with the health care delivery system, the need for formal evaluation and review and organized searching for health apps, and potential threats to safety and privacy.},

The sensor has high specificity and sensitivity to aromatic, alkyl, and chlorinated hydrocarbons with a resolution as low as 4 parts per billion (ppb), with a detection range of 4 ppb to 1000 ppm (parts per million). The sensor's performance was validated using Gas Chromatography and Selected Ion Flow Tube - Mass Spectrometry reference methods in a variety of environments and activities with overall accuracy higher than 81{\%} (r(2) > 0.9). Field tests examined personal exposure in various scenarios including: indoor and outdoor environments, traffic exposure in different cities which vary from 0 to 50 ppmC (part-per-million carbon from hydrocarbons), and pollutants near the 2010 Deepwater Horizon's oil spill. These field tests not only validated the performance but also demonstrated unprecedented high temporal and spatial toxicant information provided by the new technology.},

abstract = {The effect of psychosocial stress on health has been a central focus area of public health research. However, progress has been limited due a to lack of wearable sensors that can provide robust measures of stress in the field. In this paper, we present a wireless sensor suite called AutoSense that collects and processes cardiovascular, respiratory, and thermoregularity measurements that can inform about the general stress state of test subjects in their natural environ- ment. AutoSense overcomes several challenges in the de- sign of wearable sensor systems for use in the field. First, it is unobtrusively wearable because it integrates six sen- sors in a small form factor. Second, it demonstrates a low power design; with a lifetime exceeding ten days while con- tinuously sampling and transmitting sensor measurements. Third, sensor measurements are robust to several sources of errors and confounds inherent in field usage. Fourth, it inte- grates an ANT radio for low power and integrated quality of service guarantees, even in crowded environments. The Au- toSense suite is complemented with a software framework on a smart phone that processes sensor measurements received from AutoSense to infer stress and other rich human behav- iors. AutoSense was used in a 20+ subject real-life scientific study on stress in both the lab and field, which resulted in the first model of stress that provides 90{\%} accuracy. Categories},

This is a review of the theoretical basis and interactivity of mobile health behavior interventions. Many of the mobile health behavior interventions reviewed were predominately one way (i.e., mostly data input or informational output), but some have leveraged mobile technologies to provide just-in-time, interactive, and adaptive interventions. Most smoking and weight loss studies reported a theoretical basis for the mobile intervention, but most of the adherence and disease management studies did not. Mobile health behavior intervention development could benefit from greater application of health behavior theories. Current theories, however, appear inadequate to inform mobile intervention development as these interventions become more interactive and adaptive.

With most infectious diseases largely at bay in the developed world, the greatest contributors to suboptimal health today are largely behavioral. For example, there are three behavioral risk factors-tobacco use, poor diet, and inactivity-that contribute to four chronic diseases: heart disease, type 2 diabetes, lung disease, and some cancers. Together, these behaviors account for more than 50{\%} of preventable deaths (see the Web site 3four50.com). While medical advances will surely continue, it is likely that the next great advancements in health in the 21st century will occur via more effective behavior management.},

abstract = {The cost of a diploid human genome sequence has dropped from about {\$}70M to {\$}2000 since 2007--even as the standards for redundancy have increased from 7x to 40x in order to improve call rates. Coupled with the low return on investment for common single-nucleotide polylmorphisms, this has caused a significant rise in interest in correlating genome sequences with comprehensive environmental and trait data (GET). The cost of electronic health records, imaging, and microbial, immunological, and behavioral data are also dropping quickly. Sharing such integrated GET datasets and their interpretations with a diversity of researchers and research subjects highlights the need for informed-consent models capable of addressing novel privacy and other issues, as well as for flexible data-sharing resources that make materials and data available with minimum restrictions on use. This article examines the Personal Genome Project's effort to develop a GET database as a public genomics resource broadly accessible to both researchers and research participants, while pursuing the highest standards in research ethics.},

We provide the rationale, design, and preliminary data from 3 ongoing clinical trials of mobile interventions developed for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Project 1 used a personal digital assistant to prompt engagement in personalized self-management behaviors based on real-time data. Project 2 employed experience sampling through text messages to facilitate case management. Project 3 was built on group functional skills training for schizophrenia by incorporating between-session mobile phone contacts with therapists. Preliminary findings were of minimal participant attrition, and no broken devices; yet, several operational and technical barriers needed to be addressed. Adherence was similar to that reported in nonpsychiatric populations, with high participant satisfaction. Therefore, mobile devices seem feasible and acceptable in augmenting psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness, with future research in establishing efficacy, cost effectiveness, and ethical and safety protocols.},

abstract = {Mobile phones and devices, with their constant presence, data connectivity, and multiple intrinsic sensors, can support around-the-clock chronic disease prevention and management that is integrated with daily life. These mobile health (mHealth) devices can produce tremendous amounts of location-rich, real-time, high-frequency data. Unfortunately, these data are often full of bias, noise, variability, and gaps. Robust tools and techniques have not yet been developed to make mHealth data more meaningful to patients and clinicians. To be most useful, health data should be sharable across multiple mHealth applications and connected to electronic health records. The lack of data sharing and dearth of tools and techniques for making sense of health data are critical bottlenecks limiting the impact of mHealth to improve health outcomes. We describe Open mHealth, a nonprofit organization that is building an open software architecture to address these data sharing and "sense-making" bottlenecks. Our architecture consists of open source software modules with well-defined interfaces using a minimal set of common metadata. An initial set of modules, called InfoVis, has been developed for data analysis and visualization. A second set of modules, our Personal Evidence Architecture, will support scientific inferences from mHealth data. These Personal Evidence Architecture modules will include standardized, validated clinical measures to support novel evaluation methods, such as n-of-1 studies. All of Open mHealth's modules are designed to be reusable across multiple applications, disease conditions, and user populations to maximize impact and flexibility. We are also building an open community of developers and health innovators, modeled after the open approach taken in the initial growth of the Internet, to foster meaningful cross-disciplinary collaboration around new tools and techniques. An open mHealth community and architecture will catalyze increased mHealth efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.},

Project HealthDesign teams employed user-centered design processes to create designs and prototypes of computer-based applications to support and enhance human health for a wide range of patients, from children with chronic health conditions to elders transitioning from hospital to home. A program design philosophy encouraged designers to envision PHRs as a suite of personal health information management tools, or applications, separate from, but drawing upon, personal health data from a variety of sources. In addition to information contained in one's medical record, these personal health data included patient-supplied clinical parameters such as blood glucose and daily weights; as well as patient-generated observations of daily living (ODLs) - the unique, idiosyncratic cues, such as sleep adequacy or confidence in self care, that inform patients about their abilities to manage health challenges and take healthy action. A common technical platform provided infrastructure services such as data standards and identity-management protocols, and helped to demonstrate a scalable, efficient approach to user-centered design of personal health information management systems. The program's ethical, legal and social issues consultancy identified challenges to acceleration of action-focused PHRs: personal control of privacy choices, management of privacy in home conditions, and rebalancing power structures in shared decision making.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This 3-year field experiment engaged 60 nurses and 282 patients in the design and evaluation of an innovative home-care nursing model, referred to as technology-enhanced practice (TEP).

METHODS: Nurses using TEP augmented the usual care with a web-based resource (HeartCareII) that provided patients with self-management information, self-monitoring tools, and messaging services.

RESULTS: Patients exposed to TEP demonstrated better quality of life and self-management of chronic heart disease during the first 4 weeks, and were no more likely than patients in usual care to make unplanned visits to a clinician or hospital. Both groups demonstrated the same long-term symptom management and achievements in health status.

CONCLUSION: This project provides new evidence that the purposeful creation of patient-tailored web resources within a hospital portal is possible; that nurses have difficulty with modifying their practice routines, even with a highly-tailored web resource; and that the benefits of this intervention are more discernable in the early postdischarge stages of care.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in DNA sequencing promise to enable new diagnostics and individualized therapies. Achieving personalized medicine, however, will require extensive research on highly reidentifiable, integrated datasets of genomic and health information. To assist with this, participants in the Personal Genome Project choose to forgo privacy via our institutional review board- approved "open consent" process. The contribution of public data and samples facilitates both scientific discovery and standardization of methods. We present our findings after enrollment of more than 1,800 participants, including whole-genome sequencing of 10 pilot participant genomes (the PGP-10). We introduce the Genome-Environment-Trait Evidence (GET-Evidence) system. This tool automatically processes genomes and prioritizes both published and novel variants for interpretation. In the process of reviewing the presumed healthy PGP-10 genomes, we find numerous literature references implying serious disease. Although it is sometimes impossible to rule out a late-onset effect, stringent evidence requirements can address the high rate of incidental findings. To that end we develop a peer production system for recording and organizing variant evaluations according to standard evidence guidelines, creating a public forum for reaching consensus on interpretation of clinically relevant variants. Genome analysis becomes a two-step process: using a prioritized list to record variant evaluations, then automatically sorting reviewed variants using these annotations. Genome data, health and trait information, participant samples, and variant interpretations are all shared in the public domain-we invite others to review our results using our participant samples and contribute to our interpretations. We offer our public resource and methods to further personalized medical research.},

abstract = {Introduction: Despite the known advantages of objective physical activity monitors (e.g., accelerometers), these devices have high rates of non-wear, which leads to missing data. Objective activity monitors are also unable to capture valuable contextual information about behavior. Adolescents recruited into physical activity surveillance and intervention studies will increasingly have smartphones, which are miniature computers with built-in motion sensors. Methods: This paper describes the design and development of a smartphone application (“app”) called Mobile Teen that combines objective and self-report assessment strategies through (1) sensor-informed context-sensitive ecological momentary assessment (CS-EMA) and (2) sensor-assisted end-of-day recall.Results: The Mobile Teen app uses the mobile phone’s built-in motion sensor to automatically detect likely bouts of phone non-wear, sedentary behavior, and physical activity. The app then uses transitions between these inferred states to trigger CS-EMA self-report surveys measuring the type, purpose, and context of activity in real time. The end of the day recall component of the Mobile Teen app allows users to interactively review and label their own physical activity data each evening using visual cues from automatically-detected major activity transitions from the phone’s built-in motions sensors. Major activity transitions are identified by the app, which cues the user to label that “chunk,” or period, of time using activity categories.Conclusions: Sensor-driven CS-EMA and end-of-day recall smartphone apps can be used to augment physical activity data collected by objective activity monitors, filling in gaps during non-wear bouts and providing additional real-time data on environmental, social, and emotional correlates of behavior. Smartphone apps such as these have potential for affordable deployment in large scale epidemiological and intervention studies.},

BITs refers to behavioral and psychological interventions that use information and communication technology features to address behavioral and mental health outcomes.

METHOD: This study on the findings of the technical expert panel.

RESULTS: Videoconferencing and standard telephone technologies to deliver psychotherapy have been well validated. Web-based interventions have shown efficacy across a broad range of mental health outcomes. Social media such as online support groups have produced disappointing outcomes when used alone. Mobile technologies have received limited attention for mental health outcomes. Virtual reality has shown good efficacy for anxiety and pediatric disorders. Serious gaming has received little work in mental health.

CONCLUSION: Research focused on understanding reach, adherence, barriers and cost is recommended. Improvements in the collection, storage, analysis and visualization of big data will be required. New theoretical models and evaluation strategies will be required. Finally, for BITs to have a public health impact, research on implementation and application to prevention is required.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The United States is currently in an age of obesity and inactivity despite increasing public awareness and scientific knowledge of detrimental long-term health effects of this lifestyle. Behavior-tracking diaries offer an effective strategy for physical activity adherence and weight management. Furthermore, Web-based physical activity diaries can engage meaningful partners in people's social networks through fun online gaming interactions and generate motivational mechanisms for effective behavioral change and positive health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Wellness Partners (WP) is a Web-based intervention in the form of a physical activity diary with social networking and game features. Two versions were designed and developed for the purpose of this study-"Diary" only and "Diary+Game". The objectives of this study included pilot testing the research process of this intervention design, implementation, evaluation, and exploring the effectiveness of social gaming features on adult participants' physical activity and anthropometric measures.

METHODS: We conducted a field experiment with randomized crossover design. Assessments occurred at baseline, first follow-up (FU, 5-8 weeks after using one version of WP), and second FU (5-8 weeks of using the other version of WP). In the control condition, participants started with the "Diary" version of WP while in the experimental condition, participants started with the "Diary+Game" version of WP. A total of 54 adults (egos) ages 44-88, and their family and friends (alters) ages 17-69 participated in the study in ego-network groups. Both egos and their alters completed online surveys about their exercise habits. In addition, egos completed anthropometric measurements of BMI, fat percentage, and fat mass by bioimpedance.

RESULTS: From October 2009 to May 2010, flyers, emails, and Web advertisements yielded 335 volunteers who were screened. Rolling recruitment resulted in enrollment of 142 qualified participants in 54 ego-network groups, which were randomly assigned to a study condition. The final analytic sample included 87 individuals from 41 groups. Data were collected from December 2009 to August 2010, and data analysis was completed in 2011. Overall, the participants were given access to the intervention for 10-13 weeks. Statistical analysis suggested an increase in self-reported exercise frequency (mean days per week) from baseline (2.57, SD 1.92) to first FU (3.21, SD 1.74) in both conditions. Stronger effects were seen in the condition where Diary+Game was played first, especially in network groups with larger age variation between the alters and egos. Overall, the decrease in egos' BMI was statistically significant from baseline to first FU, with greater decrease for those in the Diary+Game first condition (-0.26 vs -0.16 in the Diary first condition).

CONCLUSIONS: The Wellness Partners program increased physical activity among participants and resulted in health benefits among the egos. Web-based diary interventions designed with social gaming features hold potential to promote active lifestyles for middle-age adults and people in their social networks.},

Technologies that have the potential to improve the quality of mental health services are developing at a phenomenal rate. In the current paper, experts from a wide array of disciplines and settings share their perspectives, experiences, and visions for technology-assisted assessment and treatment of serious mental illness in the present and not-too-distant future. First, we examine how technological advancements may help consumers better understand and utilize complex treatment systems, obtain information on mental health conditions and viable interventions, enhance treatment engagement, learn and maintain effective coping strategies, overcome some of the barriers associated with stigma, reduce treatment costs, and increase treatment access and outcomes. We then discuss the advantages of using ubiquitous mobile devices and mobile health approaches specifically, highlighting their potential in facilitating real-place/real-time individualized care. Finally, we identify some of the unique challenges emerging in the development and testing of technological platforms for services, providing suggestions for areas for future research.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are a promising channel for delivering just-in-time guidance and support for improving key daily health behaviors. Despite an explosion of mobile phone applications aimed at physical activity and other health behaviors, few have been based on theoretically derived constructs and empirical evidence. Eighty adults ages 45 years and older who were insufficiently physically active, engaged in prolonged daily sitting, and were new to smartphone technology, participated in iterative design development and feasibility testing of three daily activity smartphone applications based on motivational frames drawn from behavioral science theory and evidence. An "analytically" framed custom application focused on personalized goal setting, self-monitoring, and active problem solving around barriers to behavior change. A "socially" framed custom application focused on social comparisons, norms, and support. An "affectively" framed custom application focused on operant conditioning principles of reinforcement scheduling and emotional transference to an avatar, whose movements and behaviors reflected the physical activity and sedentary levels of the user. To explore the applications' initial efficacy in changing regular physical activity and leisure-time sitting, behavioral changes were assessed across eight weeks in 68 participants using the CHAMPS physical activity questionnaire and the Australian sedentary behavior questionnaire. User acceptability of and satisfaction with the applications was explored via a post-intervention user survey. The results indicated that the three applications were sufficiently robust to significantly improve regular moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and decrease leisure-time sitting during the 8-week behavioral adoption period. Acceptability of the applications was confirmed in the post-intervention surveys for this sample of midlife and older adults new to smartphone technology. Preliminary data exploring sustained use of the applications across a longer time period yielded promising results. The results support further systematic investigation of the efficacy of the applications for changing these key health-promoting behaviors.},

abstract = {Recent developments in our ability to capture, curate, and analyze data, the field of data-intensive science (DIS), have indeed made these interesting and challenging times for scientific practice as well as policy making in real time. We are confronted with immense datasets that challenge our ability to pool, transfer, analyze, or interpret scientific observations. We have more data available than ever before, yet more questions to be answered as well, and no clear path to answer them. We are excited by the potential for science-based solutions to humankind's problems, yet stymied by the limitations of our current cyberinfrastructure and existing public policies. Importantly, DIS signals a transformation of the hypothesis-driven tradition of science ("first hypothesize, then experiment") to one that is typified by "first experiment, then hypothesize" mode of discovery. Another hallmark of DIS is that it amasses data that are public goods (i.e., creates a "commons") that can further be creatively mined for various applications in different sectors. As such, this calls for a science policy vision that is long term. We herein reflect on how best to approach to policy making at this critical inflection point when DIS applications are being diversified in agriculture, ecology, marine biology, and environmental research internationally. This article outlines the key policy issues and gaps that emerged from the multidisciplinary discussions at the NSF-funded DIS workshop held at the Seattle Children's Research Institute in Seattle, on September 19-20, 2010.},

abstract = {Childhood obesity continues to be a significant public health issue. mHealth systems offer state-of-the-art approaches to intervention design, delivery, and diffusion of treatment and prevention efforts. Benefits include cost effectiveness, potential for real-time data collection, feedback capability, minimized participant burden, relevance to multiple types of populations, and increased dissemination capability. However, these advantages are coupled with unique challenges. This commentary discusses challenges with using mHealth strategies for child obesity prevention, such as lack of scientific evidence base describing effectiveness of commercially available applications; relatively slower speed of technology development in academic research settings as compared with industry; data security, and patient privacy; potentially adverse consequences of increased sedentary screen time, and decreased focused attention due to technology use. Implications for researchers include development of more nuanced measures of screen time and other technology-related activities, and partnering with industry for developing healthier technologies. Implications for health practitioners include monitoring, assessing, and providing feedback to child obesity program designers about users' data transfer issues, perceived security and privacy, sedentary behavior, focused attention, and maintenance of behavior change. Implications for policy makers include regulation of claims and quality of apps (especially those aimed at children), supporting standardized data encryption and secure open architecture, and resources for research-industry partnerships that improve the look and feel of technology. Partnerships between academia and industry may promote solutions, as discussed in this commentary.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity among children is a serious public health problem. It has been suggested that high levels of screen time are contributory factors that encourage sedentary lifestyles in young people. As physical inactivity and obesity levels continue to rise in young people, it has been proposed that new-generation active computer- and video-console games (otherwise known as "exergaming") may offer the opportunity to contribute to young people's energy expenditure during their free time. Although studies have produced some encouraging results regarding the energy costs involved in playing active video-console games, the energy costs of playing the authentic versions of activity-based video games are substantially larger, highlighting that active gaming is no substitute for real sports and activities. A small number of exergaming activities engage children in moderate-intensity activity, but most do not. Only 3 very small trials have considered the effects of exergaming on physical activity levels and/or other health outcomes in children. Evidence from these trials has been mixed; positive trends for improvements in some health outcomes in the intervention groups were noted in 2 trials. No adequately powered randomized, controlled trial has been published to date, and no trial has assessed the long-term impact of exergaming on children's health. We now need high-quality randomized, controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of exergaming, as well as its clinical relevance; until such studies take place, we should remain cautious about its ability to positively affect children's health.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive video games (combined with station- ary cycling) on health-related physical fitness and exercise adherence in comparison with traditional aerobic training (sta- tionary cycling alone). College-aged males were stratified (aerobic fitness and body mass) and then assigned randomly to experimental (n = 7) or control (n = 7) conditions. Program attendance, health-related physical fitness (including maximal aerobic power (VO2max), body composition, muscular strength, muscular power, and flexibility), and resting blood pressure were measured before and after training (60{\%}–75{\%} heart rate reserve, 3 d/week for 30 min/d for 6 weeks). There was a significant difference in the attendance of the interactive video game and traditional training groups (78{\%} ± 18{\%} vs. 48{\%} ± 29{\%}, respectively). VO2max was significantly increased after interactive video game (11{\%} ± 5{\%}) but not traditional (3{\%} ± 6{\%}) training. There was a significantly greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure after interactive video game (132 ± 6 vs. 123 ± 6 mmHg) than traditional (131 ± 7 vs. 128 ± 8 mmHg) training. There were no significant changes in body composition after either training program. Attendance mediated the relationships between condition and changes in health outcomes (including VO2max, vertical jump, and systolic blood pressure). The present investigation indi- cates that a training program that links interactive video games to cycle exercise results in greater improvements in health- related physical fitness than that seen after traditional cycle exercise training. It appears that greater attendance, and thus a higher volume of physical activity, is the mechanism for the differences in health-related physical fitness.},

SETTING: Research laboratories. PARTICIPANTS: Six boys and five girls aged 13-15 years. Procedure Participants were fitted with a monitoring device validated to predict energy expenditure. They played four computer games for 15 minutes each. One of the games was sedentary (XBOX 360) and the other three were active (Wii Sports). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Predicted energy expenditure, compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) predicted energy expenditure when playing Wii Sports bowling (190.6 (22.2) kJ/kg/min), tennis (202.5 (31.5) kJ/kg/min), and boxing (198.1 (33.9) kJ/kg/min) was significantly greater than when playing sedentary games (125.5 (13.7) kJ/kg/min) (P<0.001). Predicted energy expenditure was at least 65.1 (95{\%} confidence interval 47.3 to 82.9) kJ/kg/min greater when playing active rather than sedentary games. CONCLUSIONS: Playing new generation active computer games uses significantly more energy than playing sedentary computer games but not as much energy as playing the sport itself. The energy used when playing active Wii Sports games was not of high enough intensity to contribute towards the recommended daily amount of exercise in children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity tracking studies can determine when children settle into activity patterns and their risk for maintaining sedentary behaviors. This study examined the tracking of activity and sedentary behavior in relation to adiposity during middle childhood. METHODS: Activity intensities and patterns were examined during a 3-year interval in a population-based study of children using accelerometry and survey methods. Data were collected and analyzed from 1998 to 2004. Participants (n = 379) were, on average, 5.6 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 0.5) years at baseline and 8.6 (SD +/- 0.5) years at follow-up. Adiposity was measured with whole-body, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Correlation coefficients and odds ratios were used to assess tracking. The association of activity with adiposity was tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: Over the 3-year interval, Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients between baseline and follow-up activity measures were low to moderate (r = 0.18 to 0.39). Sedentary behavior was more predictable than overall activity, and tended to be more stable (r = 0.37 to 0.52), with the exception of video playing in boys (r = 0.18). Children maintaining a high degree of vigorous activity and low levels of TV viewing were less likely than peers to be in the upper quartile for adiposity at follow-up, and were less likely to gain adiposity during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behavior, including TV viewing, is moderately stable during middle childhood. Health promotion programs that specifically target maintaining high levels of vigorous activity and low levels of TV viewing may help reduce the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity.},

This study explored children's and parents' perceptions of AVGs and the likely facilitators and barriers to sustained use of AVGs. Data were gathered using focus group interviews: seven with children, four with adults. Both children and parents reported that AVGs offered a way to increase activity and improve fitness. Barriers to sustained engagement, according to parents, were the cost of AVGs and lack of space in the home to play the games. According to children, the likelihood of long-term engagement with AVGs depended on game content and child age, with AVGs being seen as more appropriate for younger children than teenagers. It would appear that there is potential for AVGs to reduce inactivity in young people. However, barriers to widespread, sustainable adoption would need to be addressed if this potential is to be realized.},

To address this, EE, heart rate (HR), and, upper limb and total body movement were assessed in 11- to 17-year-old adolescents whilst playing three active (Nintendo Wii) and one sedentary (XBOX 360) video games. Non-dominant upper limb activity, EE and HR were significantly greater during Wii Sports boxing [mean 267.2 (SD 115.8) J kg(-1) min(-1); 136.7 (24.5) beats min(-1)] than tennis or bowling (P < or = 0.044). For all active games hip activity best predicted EE (R (2) > or = 0.53), with two-measure models of HR and single-site activity data, and multi-site activity data, similarly explaining the variance in EE (R (2) > or = 0.64). The physiological cost of upper-body orientated active video games increased when movement of both upper limbs was encouraged. Improvements in EE explanatory power provide support for multi-site activity monitoring during unique, non-ambulatory activities.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of activity-enhancing screen devices on children's energy expenditure compared with performing the same activities while seated. Our hypothesis was that energy expenditure would be significantly greater when children played activity-promoting video games, compared with sedentary video games. METHODS: Energy expenditure was measured for 25 children aged 8 to 12 years, 15 of whom were lean, while they were watching television seated, playing a traditional video game seated, watching television while walking on a treadmill at 1.5 miles per hour, and playing activity-promoting video games. RESULTS: Watching television and playing video games while seated increased energy expenditure by 20 +/- 13{\%} and 22 +/- 12{\%} above resting values, respectively. When subjects were walking on the treadmill and watching television, energy expenditure increased by 138 +/- 40{\%} over resting values. For the activity-promoting video games, energy expenditure increased by 108 +/- 40{\%} with the EyeToy (Sony Computer Entertainment) and by 172 +/- 68{\%} with Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 2 (Konami Digital Entertainment). CONCLUSIONS: Energy expenditure more than doubles when sedentary screen time is converted to active screen time. Such interventions might be considered for obesity prevention and treatment.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between objective measures of sedentary behavior and cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in adolescents. A secondary aim was to evaluate the degree of association between overall and abdominal adiposity and CRFs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 210 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Measurements were made of the sum of the skinfold thicknesses at six locations (sum6), waist circumference (WC), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoproteins A-1 and B-100. A CRF score was calculated from the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and TG, HDL-C and glucose levels. Sedentary behavior was assessed over 7 days using an accelerometer. Participants were divided into tertiles according to sedentary behavior and into low and high levels of overall (sum6) and abdominal (WC) adiposity. RESULTS: Adolescents with a high level of sedentary behavior had less favorable SBP, TG and glucose levels and CRF scores. Adolescents with a high level of overall adiposity demonstrated significant differences in five of the 11 variables analyzed (i.e. DBP, LDL-C, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score), while adolescents with a high level of abdominal adiposity had differences in eight (i.e. SBP, MAP, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score). Adolescents with high levels of both overall and abdominal adiposity and sedentary behavior had the least favorable CRF scores. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behavior was associated with CRFs in adolescents, especially in obese adolescents. Abdominal adiposity seemed to play a more significant role in the development of CRFs than overall adiposity.},

The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an organizing framework based on principles of learning theory to classify and rank exergames according to embedded behavior change principles. Behavioral contingencies represent a key theory-based game design principle that can be objectively measured, evaluated, and manipulated to help explain and change the frequency and duration of game play. Case examples are presented that demonstrate how to code dimensions of behavior, consequences of behavior, and antecedents of behavior. Our framework may be used to identify game principles which, in the future, might be used to predict which games are most likely to promote adoption and maintenance of leisure time physical activity.},

The authors recorded heart rate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), respiratory exchange rate (RER), oxygen consumption (VO2), and total steps (TS30). RESULTS: Experienced participants showed higher exercise HR, RPE, RER, VO2, total and relative energy expenditure, exercise intensity, TS30, and average steps per minute, and less time and steps to expend 150 kilocalories (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Participants with greater playing experience can work at higher intensities, promoting greater energy expenditure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare energy expenditure rates in children playing the physically active video games, Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) and Nintendo's Wii Sports in relation to treadmill walking. METHODS: Energy expenditure, heart rate, step rate, and perceived exertion were measured in 14 boys and 9 girls (ages 10-13 years; BMI at 3-98th percentile for age and gender) while watching television at rest, playing DDR at 2 skill levels, playing Wii bowling and boxing, and walking at 2.6, 4.2, and 5.7 km/h. Arterial elasticity was measured at rest and immediately after gaming. RESULTS: Compared with watching television, energy expenditure while gaming or walking increased 2- to 3-fold. Similarly, high rates of energy expenditure, heart rate, and perceived exertion were elicited from playing Wii boxing, DDR level 2, or walking at 5.7 km/h. This occurred despite variations in step rate among activities, reflecting greater use of upper body during Wii play (lowest step rate) than during walking (highest step rate) or DDR play. Wii bowling and beginner level DDR elicited a 2-fold increase in energy expenditure compared to television watching. Large-artery elasticity declined immediately after both DDR and Wii. The change was inversely related to the increment in energy expenditure above rest achieved during the activity. CONCLUSIONS: Energy expenditure during active video game play is comparable to moderate-intensity walking. Thus, for children who spend considerable time playing electronic screen games for entertainment, physically active games seem to be a safe, fun, and valuable means of promoting energy expenditure.},

Greater allocation of responses for one alternative versus another reflects the relative reinforcing value of the alternatives. This method was designed for laboratory use, but methods are needed to extend measurement of reinforcing value to applied research environments. Two experiments were conducted to assess the validity of a questionnaire measure of the relative reinforcing value of food in normal weight university samples. Study 1 (n=39) assessed the relationship between the relative reinforcing value of snack food versus fruits and vegetables (condition 1) or enjoyable sedentary behaviors (condition 2) as measured by the questionnaire and standardized computerized concurrent schedules criterion. A significant relationship (Pearson r=0.49, p<0.01; Guttman's MU2=0.69) across the two conditions between the two methods of measuring food reinforcement was observed. Experiment 2 (n=10) utilized a within-subject counterbalanced design to manipulate food deprivation and hunger levels to determine if food deprivation increased the reinforcing value of snack food as measured by the questionnaire to provide an index of validity of the questionnaire. Results showed that food deprivation increased the relative reinforcing value of snack food. Results from both studies suggest that the questionnaire has good validity, and may represent an efficient and reliable method of assessing the relative reinforcing value of food.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in developed countries. Sedentary screen-based activities such as video gaming are thought to displace active behaviors and are independently associated with obesity. Active video games, where players physically interact with images onscreen, may have utility as a novel intervention to increase physical activity and improve body composition in children. The aim of the Electronic Games to Aid Motivation to Exercise (eGAME) study is to determine the effects of an active video game intervention over 6 months on: body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, waist circumference, cardio-respiratory fitness, and physical activity levels in overweight children. METHODS/DESIGN: Three hundred and thirty participants aged 10-14 years will be randomized to receive either an active video game upgrade package or to a control group (no intervention). DISCUSSION: An overview of the eGAME study is presented, providing an example of a large, pragmatic randomized controlled trial in a community setting. Reflection is offered on key issues encountered during the course of the study. In particular, investigation into the feasibility of the proposed intervention, as well as robust testing of proposed study procedures is a critical step prior to implementation of a large-scale trial.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the metabolic, physiologic, and hemostatic responses to action video game play in a group of young boys. DESIGN: Comparison study. SETTING: Laboratory of Clinical and Applied Physiology, University of Miami. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one boys aged 7 to 10 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blood pressure monitored before and during game play and blood glucose and lactate levels measured before and immediately after game play. Measurements were continuously recorded throughout game play. Dependent t tests were used to compare measurements recorded at baseline and during or after game play. Effect sizes using the Cohen d were examined for comparisons. RESULTS: Significant increases from baseline were found for heart rate (18.8{\%}; P<.001), systolic (22.3{\%}; P<.001) and diastolic (5.8{\%}; P = .006) blood pressure, ventilation (51.9{\%}; P<.001), respiratory rate (54.8{\%}; P<.001), oxygen consumption (49.0{\%}; P<.001), and energy expenditure (52.9{\%}; P<.001). Effect sizes for these comparisons were medium or large. No significant changes were found from baseline to after video game play for lactate (18.2{\%} increase; P = .07) and glucose (0.9{\%} decrease; P = .59) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Video game play results in significant increases in various metabolic and physiologic variables in young children. Thus, it should not be combined with television viewing for the evaluation of sedentary activities. The magnitude of change, however, was lower than that observed during standard physical exercise and below national health recommendations. As such, video game play should not be considered a substitute for regular physical activities that significantly stress the metabolic pathways required for the promotion of cardiovascular conditioning.},

abstract = {The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of active video games on children's physical activity levels. Twenty children (mean ± SD age = 12 ± 1.5 years; 40{\%} female) were randomised to receive either an active video game upgrade package or to a control group (no intervention). Effects on physical activity over the 12-week intervention period were measured using objective (Actigraph accelerometer) and subjective (Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children [PAQ-C]) measures. An activity log was used to estimate time spent playing active and non-active video games. Children in the intervention group spent less mean time over the total 12-week intervention period playing all video games compared to those in the control group (54 versus 98 minutes/day [difference = -44 minutes/day, 95{\%} CI [-92, 2]], p = 0.06). Average time spent in all physical activities measured with an accelerometer was higher in the active video game intervention group compared to the control group (difference at 6 weeks = 194 counts/min, p = 0.04, and at 12 weeks = 48 counts/min, p = 0.06). This preliminary study suggests that playing active video games on a regular basis may have positive effects on children's overall physical activity levels. Further research is needed to confirm if playing these games over a longer period of time could also have positive effects on children's body weight and body mass index.},

abstract = {One component of the recent obesity epidemic is the sedentary behaviour of children and adolescents e.g., use of video games consoles. The new generation of video games requires body movements and might thus increase activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether such games could have an effect on physical activity in obese adolescents in a clinical setting. Between March and May 2007 activity-promoting video games ("apvg") were offered to all 84 inpatients (aged 13-28 years) registered in a long-term rehabilitation programme on a voluntary base. Reasons for (non-)attendance were assessed. Frequency and duration of use of the activity-promoting video game sessions were documented. Furthermore, heart rate and activity counts during use of "apvg", endurance training, and strength training were measured. Of 84 inpatients, 51 used the "apvg" at least once (69{\%}) over the study period. The median weekly use of the intervention was 27min during the first week (range 0-182min), declining to zero (range 0-74min) in week four. Mean heart rate during the sessions (mean 115bpm; 95{\%} confidence interval 108-122bpm) was similar to the heart rate during strength training (106bpm; 101-112bpm). The results indicate that the video games could have an impact on the activity of obese adolescents and young adults. However, as the interest in the devices seems to be too low the suitability of them for weight reduction programmes in young people cannot be ensured.},

Adolescents who played the social exergame also expended comparable calories to actual tennis court play during a simulated lesson. Exergames, then, could promote physical activity, thereby becoming a tool to combat the obesity crisis that is affecting many youth.},

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the physiologic cost, RRV, and liking of playing Wii Sports Boxing (Wii) versus a traditional sedentary video game (SVG) in 11 lean and 13 overweight/obese 8- to 12-year-old children. METHODS: Heart rate (HR) and VO(2) were assessed during rest, treadmill walking, and playing an SVG and Wii using a counterbalance design. Liking was assessed during treadmill walking and video game play. RRV was assessed for Wii versus SVG. RESULTS: Average HR, VO(2), and liking were significantly greater for Nintendo Wii (p < or = 0.001 for all) than all other conditions. Lean children displayed a greater (p < 0.001) peak responding for access to Wii relative to the SVG while overweight/obese children did not (p > or = 0.16). CONCLUSION: Wii was a well-liked activity of greater physiologic intensity than both the SVG and treadmill walking. Lean children were more motivated while overweight/obese children were equally as motivated to play Wii relative to the SVG.},

STUDY DESIGN: In this single-group study, 22 healthy children (12 +/- 2 years; 11 male, 11 female) and 20 adults (34 +/- 11 years; 10 male, 10 female) were recruited. Energy expenditure and physical activity were measured while participants were resting, standing, watching television seated, sitting and playing a traditional sedentary video game, and while playing an activity-promoting video game (Nintendo Wii Boxing). Physical activity was measured with accelerometers, and energy expenditure was measured with an indirect calorimeter. RESULTS: Energy expenditure was significantly greater than all other activities when children or adults played Nintendo Wii (mean increase over resting, 189 +/- 63 kcal/hr, P < .001, and 148 +/- 71 kcal/hr, P < .001, respectively). When examining movement with accelerometry, children moved significantly more than adults (55 +/- 5 arbitrary acceleration units and 23 +/- 2 arbitrary acceleration units, respectively, P < .001) while playing Nintendo Wii.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine energy expenditure and cardiovascular responses in children during seated and active gaming. DESIGN: Comparison study. SETTING: Children's Exercise Laboratory, University of Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen children (aged 6-12 years) recruited from local primary schools. MAIN EXPOSURE: Active and seated computer games played by all participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resting energy expenditure and heart rate measured before gaming, during seated gaming, and during use of 2 active gaming formats (XaviX bowling and XaviX J-Mat; SSD Company Ltd, Shiga, Japan). We used repeated-measures analyses of variance to compare the outcome measures. RESULTS: The energy expenditure was significantly higher during seated gaming (mean [SD], 1.31 [0.19] kcal/min(-1); P < .001), XaviX bowling (1.89 [0.45] kcal/min(-1); P < .001), and XaviX J-Mat gaming (5.23 [1.63] kcal/min(-1); P < .001) compared with rest. The energy expended above rest was significantly higher for the 2 active gaming formats (P < .001 for both) compared with seated gaming. The heart rate was significantly higher during XaviX bowling (mean [SD, ]102 [20] beats/min(-1); P < .001) and XaviX J-Mat gaming (160 [20] beats/min(-1); P < .001) compared with rest. Heart rate during the XaviX J-Mat gaming was significantly higher than during seated gaming (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that using active gaming media results in meaningful increases in energy expenditure and heart rate compared with the seated screen environment. Manipulating the gaming environment can provide children with appealing activity alternatives, and further development of "exertainment" interventions is warranted, in particular determination of sustainability.},

Interactivity and immersion are key factors that attract exergame consumers. This research asks, What are the effects of priming the actual self versus the ideal self on users' perceived interactivity and immersion in avatar-based exergame playing? and What are important moderators that play a role in exergame users' self-concept perception? To answer these research questions, this study leveraged the Wii's avatar-creating function (Mii Channel) and exergame feature (Wii Fit) in a controlled, randomized experimental design (N = 126). The results of a 2 x 2 factorial design experiment demonstrated the significant main effect of self-priming on interactivity and the moderating role of the actual-ideal self-concept discrepancy in influencing immersion during exergame playing. Game players who created an avatar reflecting the ideal self reported greater perceived interactivity than those who created a replica avatar mirroring the actual self. A two-way ANOVA demonstrated the moderating role of the actual-ideal self-concept discrepancy in determining the effects of the primed regulatory focus on immersion in the exergame play. The underlying theoretical mechanism is derived from and explained by Higgins's self-concept discrepancy perspective. Practical implications for game developers and managerial implications for the exergame industry are discussed.},

This study examined whether a 20-week exergame (i.e., videogame that requires gross motor activity) intervention can produce weight loss and improve psychosocial outcomes for 54 overweight and obese African-American adolescents. Participants were recruited from a public high school and randomly assigned to competitive exergame, cooperative exergame, or control conditions. All exergame participants were encouraged to play the Nintendo Wii Active game for 30-60 min per school day in a lunch-time or after-school program.

Control participants continued regular daily activities. Outcome measures included changes in weight, peer support, self-efficacy, and self-esteem, measured at baseline, and at {\~{}}10 and 20 weeks. Growth curve analysis revealed that cooperative exergame players lost significantly more weight (mean = 1.65 kg; s.d. = 4.52) than the control group, which did not lose weight. The competitive exergame players did not differ significantly from the other conditions. Cooperative exergame players also significantly increased in self-efficacy compared to the control group, and both exergame conditions significantly increased in peer support more than the control group. Exergames, especially played cooperatively, can be an effective technological tool for weight loss among youth.},

abstract = {Objective. To determine whether an exercise intervention using an active video game (Dance Dance Revolution [DDR]) is effective in improving endothelial dysfunction (EDF) and other risk factors in overweight children. Design. Thirty-five children (Body mass index >/= 85(th) percentile, mean age 10.21+/-1.67 years, 17 females) with EDF were assessed for flow-mediated dilation (FMD), lipids, insulin, glucose, NO(2)+NO(3), asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric dimethylarginine, l-arginine, height, weight, aerobic fitness, and blood pressure. In a subsample, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin were also assessed. Subjects were randomly assigned to 12-weeks of aerobic exercise (EX) using DDR or to a non-exercising delayed-treatment control group (DTC). Results. EX had significant improvements in FMD ( 5.56+/-5.04{\%} compared with 0.263+/-4.54{\%}, p =0.008), exercise time on the graded exercise test (53.59+/-91.54 compared with -12.83+/-68.10 seconds, p =0.025), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (-5.62+/-7.03 compared with -1.44+/-2.16 mmHg, p =0.05), weight (0.91+/-1.53 compared with 2.43+/-1.80 kg, p =0.017) and peak VO(2) (2.38+/-3.91 compared with -1.23+/-3.18 mg/kg/min, p =0.005) compared with the DTC. Thirteen EX subjects achieved normal EDF while ten did not. These groups differed at baseline with regard to total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Conclusion. Twelve weeks of DDR-use improved FMD, aerobic fitness, and MAP in overweight children. Improvements occurred without changes in inflammatory markers or nitric oxide production.

Results indicated that while television use was not related to children's weight status, video game use was. Children with higher weight status played moderate amounts of electronic games, while children with lower weight status played either very little or a lot of electronic games. Interaction analyses revealed that this curvilinear relationship applied to children under age 8 and that girls, but not boys, with higher weight status played more video games. Children ages 9-12 with lower weight status used the computer (non-game) for moderate amounts of time, while those with higher weight status used the computer either very little or a lot. This was also true for the relationship between print use and weight status for children of all ages. Results also indicated that children with higher weight status spent more time in sedentary activities than those with lower weight status.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the energy expended and intensity of physical activity achieved by adolescent girls while playing on a dance simulation game. Twenty adolescent girls were recruited from a local secondary school. Resting oxygen uptake (.VO(2)) and heart rate were analysed while sitting quietly and subsequently during approximately 30 min of game play, with 10 min at each of three increasing levels of difficulty. Energy expenditure was predicted from .VO(2) at rest and during game play at three levels of play, from which the metabolic equivalents (METS) of game playing were derived. Mean +/- standard deviation energy expenditure for levels 1, 2, and 3 was 3.63 +/- 0.58, 3.65 +/- 0.54, and 4.14 +/- 0.71 kcal . min(-1) respectively, while mean activity for each level of play was at least of moderate intensity (>3 METS). Dance simulation active computer games provide an opportunity for most adolescent girls to exercise at moderate intensity. Therefore, regular playing might contribute to daily physical activity recommendations for good health in this at-risk population.},

Studies that used off-the-shelf AVGs to increase physical activity with quantitative outcomes or studies that quantified intensity of AVG play were included. Information on sample characteristics, AVGs employed, study design and conditions, outcome measures, results, and conclusions was extracted by two researchers. Intervention studies were ranked on design quality. Thirteen interventions and 28 laboratory studies were identified. All laboratory studies demonstrated that AVGs are capable of providing light-to-moderate intensity physical activity. However, only three interventions supported AVGs as an effective tool to significantly increase physical activity or exercise attendance. As AVGs are becoming more popular, additional research is needed to determine how to capitalize on the potential of AVGs to increase physical activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To systematically review levels of metabolic expenditure and changes in activity patterns associated with active video game (AVG) play in children and to provide directions for future research efforts. DATA SOURCES: A review of the English-language literature (January 1, 1998, to January 1, 2010) via ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and Scholars Portal using the following keywords: video game, exergame, physical activity, fitness, exercise, energy metabolism, energy expenditure, heart rate, disability, injury, musculoskeletal, enjoyment, adherence, and motivation. STUDY SELECTION: Only studies involving youth (< or = 21 years) and reporting measures of energy expenditure, activity patterns, physiological risks and benefits, and enjoyment and motivation associated with mainstream AVGs were included. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Articles were reviewed and data were extracted and synthesized by 2 independent reviewers. MAIN OUTCOME EXPOSURES: Energy expenditure during AVG play compared with rest (12 studies) and activity associated with AVG exposure (6 studies). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage increase in energy expenditure and heart rate (from rest). RESULTS: Activity levels during AVG play were highly variable, with mean (SD) percentage increases of 222{\%} (100{\%}) in energy expenditure and 64{\%} (20{\%}) in heart rate. Energy expenditure was significantly lower for games played primarily through upper body movements compared with those that engaged the lower body (difference, -148{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval, -231{\%} to -66{\%}; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The AVGs enable light to moderate physical activity. Limited evidence is available to draw conclusions on the long-term efficacy of AVGs for physical activity promotion.},

The effect of reducing television watching and other sedentary behaviors as a component of a comprehensive obesity treatment program has not been thoroughly tested. OBJECTIVE: To compare the influence of targeting decreases in sedentary behavior vs. increases in physical activity in the comprehensive treatment of obesity in 8- to 12-year-old children. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled outcome study. SETTING: Childhood obesity research clinic. DESIGN: Ninety families with obese 8- to 12-year-old children were randomly assigned to groups that were provided a comprehensive family-based behavioral weight control program that included dietary, and behavior change information but differed in whether sedentary or physically active behaviors were targeted and the degree of behavior change required. RESULTS: Results during 2 years showed that targeting either decreased sedentary behaviors or increased physical activity was associated with significant decreases in percent overweight and body fat and improved aerobic fitness. Self-reported activity minutes increased and targeted sedentary time decreased during treatment. Children substituted nontargeted sedentary behaviors for some of their targeted sedentary behaviors. CONCLUSION: These results support reducing sedentary behaviors as an adjunct in the treatment of pediatric obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interactive video games are a popular alternative to physical activity in youth. One advancement in computer games are interactive games that use physical activity as a game playing controller, combining exercise and entertainment, or exertainment. PURPOSE: This study tested the reinforcing value and activity levels of interactive dance and bicycle race games in 18 overweight and 17 nonoverweight 8- to 12-year-old youth. METHODS: Reinforcing value was studied using a behavioral choice paradigm that provided children the opportunity to respond on progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement for a choice of either playing the video dance or bicycle game using a handheld video game controller or one of three options: dancing or bicycling alone, dancing or bicycling while watching a video, or playing the interactive dance or bicycle game. Reinforcing value was defined in relationship to the amount of responding children engaged in for either choice. RESULTS: Results showed the interactive dance game was more reinforcing than dancing alone or dancing while watching the video (p = .003), but there was no difference across bicycling conditions. Nonoverweight youth were more active when given the opportunity to play the interactive dance game than overweight children (p = .05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that children may be motivated to be active when given the opportunity to play an interactive dance game.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to: (1) determine energy expenditure (EE) during a range of active video games (AVGs) and (2) determine whether EE during AVGs is influenced by gaming experience or fitness. Twenty-six boys (11.4+/-0.8 years) participated and performed a range of sedentary activities (resting, watching television and sedentary gaming), playing AVGs (Nintendo((R)) Wii Bowling, Boxing, Tennis, and Wii Fit Skiing and Step), walking and running including a maximal fitness test. During all activities, oxygen uptake, heart rate and EE were determined. The AVGs resulted in a significantly higher EE compared to rest (63-190{\%}, p</=0.001) and sedentary screen-time activities (56-184{\%}, p</=0.001). No significant differences in EE were found between the most active video games and walking. There was no evidence to suggest that gaming experience or aerobic fitness influenced EE when playing AVGs. In conclusion, boys expended more energy during active gaming compared to sedentary activities. Whilst EE during AVG is game-specific, AVGs are not intense enough to contribute towards the 60min of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that is currently recommended for children.},

abstract = {We provide a wide-ranging review of health-related physical activity in children and adolescents using a behavioural epidemiology framework. In contrast to many other reviews, we highlight issues associated with true sedentary behaviours alongside physically active behaviours. Specifically, we review the evidence concerning the links between physical activity and cardiovascular disease, overweight and obesity, psychosocial measures, type II diabetes, and skeletal health. Although the evidence is unconvincing at times, several factors lead to the conclusion that promoting physical activity in youth is desirable. A review of the prevalence of physical activity and sedentary behaviours shows that many young people are active, but this declines with age. A substantial number are not adequately active for health benefits and current trends in juvenile obesity are a cause for concern. Prevalence data on sedentary behaviours are less extensive but suggest that total media use by young people has not changed greatly in recent years. Most children and adolescents do not exceed recommended daily hours of TV viewing. Physical activity is unrelated to TV viewing. We also identified the key determinants of physical activity in this age group, highlighting demographic, biological, psychological, behavioural, social and environmental determinants. Interventions were considered for school, family and community environments. Finally, policy recommendations are offered for the education, governmental, sport and recreation, health, and mass media sectors.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Active video game systems controlled through arm gestures and motions (Nintendo Wii Sports) and video games controlled through force plate (Wii Fit Plus) are becoming increasingly popular. This study was performed to determine the energy expenditure (EE) during Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports game activities. METHODS: Twelve adult men and women performed all the activities of Wii Sports (five activities: golf, bowling, tennis, baseball, and boxing) and Wii Fit Plus (63 activities classified as yoga, resistance, balance, and aerobic exercises). Each activity was continued for at least 8 min to obtain a steady-state EE. Because EE was assessed in an open-circuit indirect metabolic chamber consisting of an airtight room (20,000 or 15,000 L), subjects were freed of apparatus to collect expired gas while playing the games. MET value was calculated from resting EE and steady-state EE during activity. RESULTS: The mean MET values of all 68 activities were distributed over a wide range from 1.3 METs (Lotus Focus) to 5.6 METs (single-arm stand). The mean MET values in yoga, balance, resistance, and aerobic exercise of Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports were 2.1, 2.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.0 METs, respectively. Forty-six activities (67{\%}) were classified as light intensity (<3 METs), and 22 activities (33{\%}) were classified as moderate intensity (3.0-6.0 METs). There were no vigorous-intensity activities (>6.0 METs). CONCLUSIONS: Time spent playing one-third of the activities supplied by motion- and gesture-controlled video games can count toward the daily amount of exercise required according to the guidelines provided by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association, which focus on 30 min of moderate-intensity daily physical activity 5 d x wk(-1).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the notion that playing video games is negatively related to the time adolescents spend in more developmentally appropriate activities. DESIGN: Nonexperimental study. SETTING: Survey data collected during the 2002-2003 school year. PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative sample of 1491 children aged 10 to 19 years. Main Outcome Measure Twenty-four-hour time-use diaries were collected on 1 weekday and 1 weekend day, both randomly chosen. Time-use diaries were used to determine adolescents' time spent playing video games, with parents and friends, reading and doing homework, and in sports and active leisure. RESULTS: Differences in time spent between game players and nonplayers as well as the magnitude of the relationships among game time and activity time among adolescent game players were assessed. Thirty-six percent of adolescents (80{\%} of boys and 20{\%} of girls) played video games. On average, gamers played for an hour on the weekdays and an hour and a half on the weekends. Compared with nongamers, adolescent gamers spent 30{\%} less time reading and 34{\%} less time doing homework. Among gamers (both genders), time spent playing video games without parents or friends was negatively related to time spent with parents and friends in other activities. CONCLUSIONS: Although gamers and nongamers did not differ in the amount of time they spent interacting with family and friends, concerns regarding gamers' neglect of school responsibilities (reading and homework) are warranted. Although only a small percentage of girls played video games, our findings suggest that playing video games may have different social implications for girls than for boys.},

We systematically observed 60 Hong Kong primary school children during two 60-minute game sessions while simultaneously recording their game mode choices and physical activity levels using SOFIT (System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time). Results. When given free choice, children spent more than half of their available time participating in interactive versions of games. These versions of games provided significantly more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and greater energy expenditure than the computer screen versions. Children with the opportunity to modify intensity levels spent more time playing the interactive versions and accrued more physical activity. Conclusions. The tenets of behavioral choice theory were supported. Access to new-generation interactive games, particularly those with modifiable intensity levels, may facilitate children's participation in physical activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined associations between the family environment and children's television (TV) viewing and likelihood of being low-active. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: In 2001, children were recruited from 19 primary schools in Melbourne, Australia. Parents completed a questionnaire about their child's TV viewing and the family environment. Children also completed a questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for 8 days. Movement counts were used to identify low-active children (lowest quartile). Data were analyzed in May 2004. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 878 children (mean age = 11.5 +/- 0.6 yrs). Multiple logistic regression revealed that socioeconomic status [adjusted odds ratios (AOR) = 0.4 boys], frequency families watched TV together (AOR = 2.0 boys), mothers' (AOR = 1.8 boys; AOR = 2.5 girls) and fathers' (AOR = 2.6 boys; AOR = 2.8 girls) TV viewing, and rules prohibiting TV during mealtimes (AOR = 0.6 boys; AOR = 0.6 girls) related to children watching TV >or=2 h/d. Variables associated with low-level physical activity included self-reported enjoyment of Internet use (AOR = 1.7 boys) and preference for watching TV (AOR = 2.3 girls), perception that mother uses computer a lot (AOR = 1.9 boys) and likes using the computer (AOR = 0.6 girls), fathers' reported computer/electronic games use (AOR = 1.7 girls), frequency families used computer together (AOR = 0.4 girls), rules that TV viewing must be supervised (AOR = 1.9 boys; AOR = 0.6 girls), and having pay TV (AOR = 0.6 boys) and electronic games at home (AOR = 2.6 boys). DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that the relationships between the family environment and TV viewing and low-level activity are complex and that these behaviors are distinct.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Self-management of risk behaviors is a cornerstone of future population health interventions. Using mobile phones for routine self-monitoring and feedback is a cost-efficient strategy for self-management and ecological momentary interventions (EMI). However, mobile health applications need to be designed to be highly attractive and acceptable to a broad range of user groups. To inform the design of an adaptable mobile health application we aimed to identify the dimensions and range of user preferences for application features by different user groups.

METHODS: Five focus group interviews were conducted: two (n=9; n=20) with people living with HIV (PLH) and three with young mothers (n=6; n=8; n=10). Thematic analyses were conducted on the focus group sessions' notes and transcripts.

RESULTS: Both groups considered customization of reminders and prompts as necessary, and goal setting, motivational messaging, problem solving, and feedback as attractive. For PLH, automated and location-based reminders for medication adherence and sharing data with healthcare providers were both acceptable and attractive features. Privacy protection and invasiveness were the primary concerns, particularly around location tracking, illegal drug use, and sexual partner information. Concerns were ameliorated by use scenario or purpose, monetary incentives, and password protection. Privacy was not a major concern to mothers who considered passwords burdensome. Mothers' preferences focused on customization that supports mood, exercise and eating patterns, and especially using the mobile phone camera to photograph food to increase self-accountability.

CONCLUSIONS: Individualization emerged as the key feature and design principle to reduce user burden and increase attractiveness and acceptability. Mobile phone EMI uniquely enables individualization, context-aware and real-time feedback, and tailored intervention delivery.},

abstract = {The concepts of "self-tracking" and "the quantified self" have recently begun to emerge in discussions of how best to optimize one's life. These concepts refer to the practice of gathering data about oneself on a regular basis and then recording and analyzing the data to produce statistics and other data (such as images) relating to one's bodily functions and everyday habits. Some self-trackers collect data on only one or two dimensions of their lives, and only for a short time. Others may do so for hundreds of phenomena and for long periods.The tracking and analysis of aspects of one's self and one's body are not new practices. People have been recording their habits and health-related metrics for centuries as part of attempts at self-reflection and self-improvement. What is indisputably new is the term “the quantified self” and its associated movement, which includes a dedicated website with that title, and regular meetings and conferences, as well as the novel ways of self-tracking using digital technologies that have developed in recent years. A growing range of digital devices with associated apps are now available for self-tracking. Many of these devicescan be worn on or close to the body to measure elements of the user's everyday life and activities and produce data that can be recorded and monitored by the user. They include not only digital cameras, smartphones, tablet computers, watches, wireless weight scales, and blood pressure monitors, but also wearable bands or patches, clip-on devices and jewelry with embedded sensors able to measure bodily functions or movement and upload data wirelessly. In many of these devices global positioning devices, gyroscopes, altimeters, and accelerometers provide spatial location and quantify movement. These technologies allow self-trackers to collect data on their moods, diet, dreams, social encounters, posture, sexual activity, blood chemistry, heart rate, body temperature, exercise patterns, brain- function, alcohol, coffee and tobacco consumption, and many other variables.},

This paper reports on a triangulated approach to developing DRN data governance requirements based on a combination of policy analysis with experts, interviews with institutional leaders, and patient focus groups. This approach is illustrated with an example from the Scalable National Network for Effectiveness Research, which resulted in 91 requirements. These requirements were analyzed against the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protected versus non-protected health information. The requirements addressed all FIPPs, showing how a DRN's technical infrastructure is able to fulfill HIPAA regulations, protect privacy, and provide a trustworthy platform for research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the efficacy of adding a technology-based program to an in-person, behavioral weight loss intervention.

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Fifty-seven subjects (BMI=33.1+/-2.8 kg/m2; age=41.3+/-8.7 years) participated in a 12-week intervention with random assignment to Standard In-Person Behavioral Weight Control Program (SBWP) or Intermittent or Continuous Technology-Based Program (INT-TECH, CON-TECH). SBWP subjects received seven individualized weight loss sessions encouraging dietary and exercise modifications. INT-TECH and CON-TECH subjects received all SBWP components; additionally, these groups used a SenseWear Pro Armband (BodyMedia, Inc.) to monitor energy expenditure and an Internet-based program to monitor eating behaviors. These features were used by INT-TECH subjects during weeks 1, 5, and 9 and CON-TECH subjects weekly throughout the intervention.

RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analysis revealed weight loss of 4.1+/-2.8 kg, 3.4+/-3.4 kg, and 6.2+/-4.0 kg, for SBWP, INT-TECH, and CON-TECH groups, respectively (CON-TECH>INT-TECH, p<or=0.05).

DISCUSSION: These results indicate that the technology-based program needs to be used continuously throughout the intervention period to significantly impact weight loss. Future studies should examine the long-term and independent effect of this technology on weight loss, and for whom this intervention format is most effective.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This 3-year field experiment engaged 60 nurses and 282 patients in the design and evaluation of an innovative home-care nursing model, referred to as technology-enhanced practice (TEP).

METHODS: Nurses using TEP augmented the usual care with a web-based resource (HeartCareII) that provided patients with self-management information, self-monitoring tools, and messaging services.

RESULTS: Patients exposed to TEP demonstrated better quality of life and self-management of chronic heart disease during the first 4 weeks, and were no more likely than patients in usual care to make unplanned visits to a clinician or hospital. Both groups demonstrated the same long-term symptom management and achievements in health status.

CONCLUSION: This project provides new evidence that the purposeful creation of patient-tailored web resources within a hospital portal is possible; that nurses have difficulty with modifying their practice routines, even with a highly-tailored web resource; and that the benefits of this intervention are more discernable in the early postdischarge stages of care.},

abstract = {The health and well-being of all individuals, independent of race, ethnicity, or gender, is a significant public health concern. Despite many improvements in the status of minority health, African American males continue to have the highest age-adjusted mortality rate of any race-sex group in the United States. Such disparities are accounted for by deaths from a number of diseases such as diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cancer, and cardiovascular disease, as well as by many historical and present social and cultural constructs that present as obstacles to better health outcomes. Distrust of the medical community, inadequate education, low socioeconomic status, social deprivation, and underutilized primary health care services all contribute to disproportionate health and health care outcomes among African Americans compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Results of clinical research on diseases that disproportionately affect African American males are often limited in their reliability due to common sampling errors existing in the majority of biomedical research studies and clinical trials. There are many reasons for underrepresentation of African American males in clinical trials, including their common recollection and interpretation of relevant historical of biomedical events where minorities were abused or exposed to racial discrimination or racist provocation. In addition, African American males continue to be less educated and more disenfranchised from the majority in society than Caucasian males and females and their African American female counterparts. As such, understanding their perceptions, even in early developmental years, about health and obstacles to involvement in research is important. In an effort to understand perspectives about their level of participation, motivation for participation, impact of education, and engagement in research, this study was designed to explore factors that impact their willingness to participate. Our research suggests that: (1) African American males across all ages are willing to participate in several types of research studies, even those that require human samples; (2) their level of participation is significantly influenced by education level; and (3) their decision to participate in research studies is motivated by civic duty, monetary compensation, and whether they or a relative has had the disease of interest. However, African American males, across all age groups, continue to report a lack of trust as a primary reason for their unwillingness to participate in biomedical research. There is an ongoing need to continue to seek advice, improve communication, and design research studies that garner trust and improve participation among African American males as a targeted underrepresented population. Such communication and dialogues should occur at all age levels of research development to assess. current attitudes and behaviors of African American males around participation.},

Many of the mobile health behavior interventions reviewed were predominately one way (i.e., mostly data input or informational output), but some have leveraged mobile technologies to provide just-in-time, interactive, and adaptive interventions. Most smoking and weight loss studies reported a theoretical basis for the mobile intervention, but most of the adherence and disease management studies did not. Mobile health behavior intervention development could benefit from greater application of health behavior theories.

However, it is presently not possible to automatically capture and objectively assess an individual's eating behavior. Currently used dietary assessment and journaling approaches have several limitations; they pose a significant burden on individuals and are often not detailed or accurate enough. In this paper, we describe an approach where we leverage human computation to identify eating moments in first-person point-of-view images taken with wearable cameras. Recognizing eating moments is a key first step both in terms of automating dietary assessment and building systems that help individuals reflect on their diet. In a feasibility study with 5 participants over 3 days, where 17,575 images were collected in total, our method was able to recognize eating moments with 89.68{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The United States is currently in an age of obesity and inactivity despite increasing public awareness and scientific knowledge of detrimental long-term health effects of this lifestyle. Behavior-tracking diaries offer an effective strategy for physical activity adherence and weight management. Furthermore, Web-based physical activity diaries can engage meaningful partners in people's social networks through fun online gaming interactions and generate motivational mechanisms for effective behavioral change and positive health outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: Wellness Partners (WP) is a Web-based intervention in the form of a physical activity diary with social networking and game features. Two versions were designed and developed for the purpose of this study-"Diary" only and "Diary+Game". The objectives of this study included pilot testing the research process of this intervention design, implementation, evaluation, and exploring the effectiveness of social gaming features on adult participants' physical activity and anthropometric measures.

METHODS: We conducted a field experiment with randomized crossover design. Assessments occurred at baseline, first follow-up (FU, 5-8 weeks after using one version of WP), and second FU (5-8 weeks of using the other version of WP). In the control condition, participants started with the "Diary" version of WP while in the experimental condition, participants started with the "Diary+Game" version of WP. A total of 54 adults (egos) ages 44-88, and their family and friends (alters) ages 17-69 participated in the study in ego-network groups. Both egos and their alters completed online surveys about their exercise habits. In addition, egos completed anthropometric measurements of BMI, fat percentage, and fat mass by bioimpedance.

RESULTS: From October 2009 to May 2010, flyers, emails, and Web advertisements yielded 335 volunteers who were screened. Rolling recruitment resulted in enrollment of 142 qualified participants in 54 ego-network groups, which were randomly assigned to a study condition. The final analytic sample included 87 individuals from 41 groups. Data were collected from December 2009 to August 2010, and data analysis was completed in 2011. Overall, the participants were given access to the intervention for 10-13 weeks. Statistical analysis suggested an increase in self-reported exercise frequency (mean days per week) from baseline (2.57, SD 1.92) to first FU (3.21, SD 1.74) in both conditions. Stronger effects were seen in the condition where Diary+Game was played first, especially in network groups with larger age variation between the alters and egos. Overall, the decrease in egos' BMI was statistically significant from baseline to first FU, with greater decrease for those in the Diary+Game first condition (-0.26 vs -0.16 in the Diary first condition).

CONCLUSIONS: The Wellness Partners program increased physical activity among participants and resulted in health benefits among the egos. Web-based diary interventions designed with social gaming features hold potential to promote active lifestyles for middle-age adults and people in their social networks.},

@article{Akar2013b,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend using remote patient monitoring (RPM) for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, but the patterns of adoption of this technology have not been described. Successful use of RPM depends on (1) the enrollment of the patient into an RPM system and (2) subsequent activation of RPM by the enrolled patient. We examined RPM enrollment and activation rates and the patient, physician, and institutional determinants of RPM use.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Information about the use of RPM-capable devices was obtained from the Boston Scientific Corporation ALTITUDE program and linked to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry. Patients were first categorized as RPM-enrolled and RPM-not enrolled, and the RPM-enrolled patients were further categorized into RPM-active and RPM-inactive groups based on whether they transmitted RPM data. Variables associated with RPM enrollment and activation were identified with the use of multivariable logistic regression. Among 39 158 patients with newly implanted RPM-capable devices, 62{\%} (n=24 113) were RPM-enrolled. Of those enrolled, 76{\%} (n=18 289, or 47{\%} of the entire cohort) activated their device. RPM enrollment was highly variable among institutions. The hospital-specific median odds ratio for RPM enrollment was 3.43, signifying that physician or institutional factors are associated with RPM enrollment. In contrast, the hospital-specific median odds ratio for RPM activation was 1.69. Age, race, health insurance, geographic location, and health-related factors were similarly associated with both RPM enrollment and activation.

CONCLUSIONS: RPM technology is used in less than half of eligible patients. Lack of enrollment into RPM systems is the major cause of underutilization, and this primarily relates to the local practice environment.},

abstract = {We are in the midst of what some have called a "mobile health revolution". Medical applications ("apps") for mobile phones are proliferating in the marketplace and clinicians are likely encountering patients with questions about the medical value of these apps. We conducted a review of medical apps focused on endocrine disease. We found a higher percentage of relevant apps in our searches of the iPhone app store compared with the Android marketplace. For our diabetes search in the iPhone store, the majority of apps (33{\%}) focused on health tracking (blood sugars, insulin doses, carbohydrates), requiring manual entry of health data. Only two apps directly inputted blood sugars from glucometers attached to the mobile phone. The remainder of diabetes apps were teaching/training apps (22{\%}), food reference databases (8{\%}), social blogs/forums (5{\%}), and physician directed apps (8{\%}). We found a number of insulin dose calculator apps which technically meet criteria for being a medically regulated mobile application, but did not find evidence for FDA-approval despite their availability to consumers. Far fewer apps were focused on other endocrine disease and included medical reference for the field of endocrinology, access to endocrine journals, height predictors, medication trackers, and fertility apps. Although mobile health apps have great potential for improving chronic disease care, they face a number of challenges including lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness, lack of integration with the health care delivery system, the need for formal evaluation and review and organized searching for health apps, and potential threats to safety and privacy.},

abstract = {The effect of psychosocial stress on health has been a central focus area of public health research. However, progress has been limited due a to lack of wearable sensors that can provide robust measures of stress in the field. In this paper, we present a wireless sensor suite called AutoSense that collects and processes cardiovascular, respiratory, and thermoregularity measurements that can inform about the general stress state of test subjects in their natural environ- ment. AutoSense overcomes several challenges in the de- sign of wearable sensor systems for use in the field. First, it is unobtrusively wearable because it integrates six sen- sors in a small form factor. Second, it demonstrates a low power design; with a lifetime exceeding ten days while con- tinuously sampling and transmitting sensor measurements. Third, sensor measurements are robust to several sources of errors and confounds inherent in field usage. Fourth, it inte- grates an ANT radio for low power and integrated quality of service guarantees, even in crowded environments. The Au- toSense suite is complemented with a software framework on a smart phone that processes sensor measurements received from AutoSense to infer stress and other rich human behav- iors. AutoSense was used in a 20+ subject real-life scientific study on stress in both the lab and field, which resulted in the first model of stress that provides 90{\%} accuracy. Categories},

abstract = {Our current health research enterprise is painstakingly slow and cumbersome, and its results seldom translate into practice. The slow pace of health research contributes to findings that are less relevant and potentially even obsolete. To produce more rapid, responsive, and relevant research, we propose approaches that increase relevance via greater stakeholder involvement, speed research via innovative designs, streamline review processes, and create and/or better leverage research infrastructure. Broad stakeholder input integrated throughout the research process can both increase relevance and facilitate study procedures. More flexible and rapid research designs should be considered before defaulting to the traditional two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), but even traditional RCTs can be designed for more rapid findings. Review processes for grant applications, IRB protocols, and manuscript submissions can be better streamlined to minimize delays. Research infrastructures such as rapid learning systems and other health information technologies can be leveraged to rapidly evaluate new and existing treatments, and alleviate the extensive recruitment delays common in traditional research. These and other approaches are feasible but require a culture shift among the research community to value not only methodological rigor, but also the pace and relevance of research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A learning health system enables patients, clinicians, and researchers to work together to choose care based on the best evidence, drive discovery as a natural outgrowth of patient care, and ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value in health care; all in a more real-time fashion.

OBJECTIVE: Our paper describes how goal-directed design (GDD) methods were employed to understand the context and goals of potential participants in such a system as part of a design process to translate the concept of a learning health system into a prototype collaborative chronic care network (C3N), specifically for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease.

METHODS: Thirty-six one-on-one in-depth interviews and observations were conducted with patients (10/36, 28{\%}), caregivers (10/36, 28{\%}), physicians/researchers (10/36, 28{\%}), and nurses (6/36, 17{\%}) from a pediatric gastroenterology center participating in the ImproveCareNow network. GDD methods were used to determine the context and goals of participants. These same methods were used in conjunction with idealized design process techniques to help determine characteristics of a learning health system for this pediatric health care ecology. Research was conducted in a clinic and, in the case of some patients and caregivers, at home.

RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed 3 parent-child dyad personas (ie, representations of interviewees' behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and contextual information) that represented adaptation to a chronic illness over time. These were used as part of a design process to generate scenarios (potential interactions between personas and the learning health system under design) from which system requirements were derived. These scenarios in turn helped guide generation, prioritization, design, measurement, and implementation of approximately 100 prototype interventions consistent with the aim of C3N becoming a learning health network.

CONCLUSIONS: GDD methods help ensure human goals and contexts inform the design of a network of health care interventions which reflect the shape and purpose of a C3N in pediatric chronic illness care. Developing online and in-person interventions according to well-documented context and motivations of participants increases the likelihood that a C3N will enable all participants to act in ways that achieve their goals with grace and dignity. GDD methods complemented quality-improvement methods to generate prototypes consistent with clinical and research aims, as well as the goals of patient disease management.},

Field tests examined personal exposure in various scenarios including: indoor and outdoor environments, traffic exposure in different cities which vary from 0 to 50 ppmC (part-per-million carbon from hydrocarbons), and pollutants near the 2010 Deepwater Horizon's oil spill. These field tests not only validated the performance but also demonstrated unprecedented high temporal and spatial toxicant information provided by the new technology.},

abstract = {The healthcare system is in crisis due to challenges including escalating costs, the inconsistent provision of care, an aging population, and high burden of chronic disease related to health behaviors. Mitigating this crisis will require a major transformation of healthcare to be proactive, preventive, patient-centered, and evidence-based with a focus on improving quality-of-life. Information technology, networking, and biomedical engineering are likely to be essential in making this transformation possible with the help of advances, such as sensor technology, mobile computing, machine learning, etc. This paper has three themes: 1) motivation for a transformation of healthcare; 2) description of how information technology and engineering can support this transformation with the help of computational models; and 3) a technical overview of several research areas that illustrate the need for mathematical modeling approaches, ranging from sparse sampling to behavioral phenotyping and early detection. A key tenet of this paper concerns complementing prior work on patient-specific modeling and simulation by modeling neuropsychological, behavioral, and social phenomena. The resulting models, in combination with frequent or continuous measurements, are likely to be key components of health interventions to enhance health and wellbeing and the provision of healthcare.},

abstract = {Abstract Biological processes are fundamentally driven by complex interactions between biomolecules. Integrated high-throughput omics studies enable multifaceted views of cells, organisms, or their communities. With the advent of new post-genomics technologies, omics studies are becoming increasingly prevalent; yet the full impact of these studies can only be realized through data harmonization, sharing, meta-analysis, and integrated research. These essential steps require consistent generation, capture, and distribution of metadata. To ensure transparency, facilitate data harmonization, and maximize reproducibility and usability of life sciences studies, we propose a simple common omics metadata checklist. The proposed checklist is built on the rich ontologies and standards already in use by the life sciences community. The checklist will serve as a common denominator to guide experimental design, capture important parameters, and be used as a standard format for stand-alone data publications. The omics metadata checklist and data publications will create efficient linkages between omics data and knowledge-based life sciences innovation and, importantly, allow for appropriate attribution to data generators and infrastructure science builders in the post-genomics era. We ask that the life sciences community test the proposed omics metadata checklist and data publications and provide feedback for their use and improvement.},

abstract = {Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are web-based and mobile interventions intended to support patients and consumers in changing behaviors related to health, mental health, and well-being. BITs are provided to patients and consumers in clinical care settings and commercial marketplaces, frequently with little or no evaluation. Current evaluation methods, including RCTs and implementation studies, can require years to validate an intervention. This timeline is fundamentally incompatible with the BIT environment, where technology advancement and changes in consumer expectations occur quickly, necessitating rapidly evolving interventions. However, BITs can routinely and iteratively collect data in a planned and strategic manner and generate evidence through systematic prospective analyses, thereby creating a system that can "learn." A methodologic framework, Continuous Evaluation of Evolving Behavioral Intervention Technologies (CEEBIT), is proposed that can support the evaluation of multiple BITs or evolving versions, eliminating those that demonstrate poorer outcomes, while allowing new BITs to be entered at any time. CEEBIT could be used to ensure the effectiveness of BITs provided through deployment platforms in clinical care organizations or BIT marketplaces. The features of CEEBIT are described, including criteria for the determination of inferiority, determination of BIT inclusion, methods of assigning consumers to BITs, definition of outcomes, and evaluation of the usefulness of the system. CEEBIT offers the potential to collapse initial evaluation and postmarketing surveillance, providing ongoing assurance of safety and efficacy to patients and consumers, payers, and policymakers.},

An opportunity exists to impact public health by re-considering this pervasive interface. Toward that end, we investigated the correspondence between consumers' perceptions of weight data and the realities of weight fluctuation. Through an analysis of online product reviews, a journaling study on weight fluctuations, expert interviews, and a large-scale survey of scale users, we found that consumers' perception of weight scale behavior is often disconnected from scales' capabilities and from clinical relevance, and that accurate understanding of weight fluctuation is associated with greater trust in the scale itself. We propose significant changes to how weight data should be presented and discuss broader implications for the design of other ubiquitous health sensing devices.},

The cost of electronic health records, imaging, and microbial, immunological, and behavioral data are also dropping quickly. Sharing such integrated GET datasets and their interpretations with a diversity of researchers and research subjects highlights the need for informed-consent models capable of addressing novel privacy and other issues, as well as for flexible data-sharing resources that make materials and data available with minimum restrictions on use. This article examines the Personal Genome Project's effort to develop a GET database as a public genomics resource broadly accessible to both researchers and research participants, while pursuing the highest standards in research ethics.},

abstract = {Various innovative chemical sensors have been developed in recent years to sense dangerous substances in air and trace biomarkers in breath. However, in order to solve real world problems, the sensors must be equipped with efficient sample conditioning that can, e.g., control the humidity, which is discussed much less in the literature. To meet the demand, a miniaturized mouthpiece was developed for personal breath analyzers. A key function of the mouthpiece is to condition the humidity in real breath samples without changing the analyte concentrations and introducing substantial backpressure, which is achieved with optimized packing of desiccant particles. Numerical simulations were carried out to determine the performance of the mouthpiece in terms of various controllable parameters, such as the size, density, and geometry of the packing. Mouthpieces with different configurations were built and tested, and the experimental data validated the simulation findings. A mouthpiece with optimized performance reducing relative humidity from 95{\%} (27,000 ppmV) to 29{\%} (8000 ppmV) whereas retaining 92{\%} nitric oxide (50 ppbV to 46 ppbV) was built and integrated into a hand-held exhaled nitric oxide sensor, and the performance of exhaled nitric oxide measurement was in good agreement with the gold standard chemiluminescence technique. Acetone, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and ammonia samples were also measured after passing through the desiccant mouthpiece using commercial sensors to examine wide applicability of this breath conditioning approach.},

abstract = {Hot weather increases risk of mortality. Previous studies used different sets of weather variables to characterize heat stress, resulting in variation in heat-mortality associations depending on the metric used. We employed a statistical learning method - random forests - to examine which of the various weather variables had the greatest impact on heat-related mortality. We compiled a summertime daily weather and mortality counts dataset from four U.S. cities (Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI; Philadelphia, PA; and Phoenix, AZ) from 1998 to 2006. A variety of weather variables were ranked in predicting deviation from typical daily all-cause and cause-specific death counts. Ranks of weather variables varied with city and health outcome. Apparent temperature appeared to be the most important predictor of heat-related mortality for all-cause mortality. Absolute humidity was, on average, most frequently selected as one of the top variables for all-cause mortality and seven cause-specific mortality categories. Our analysis affirms that apparent temperature is a reasonable variable for activating heat alerts and warnings, which are commonly based on predictions of total mortality in next few days. Additionally, absolute humidity should be included in future heat-health studies. Finally, random forests can be used to guide the choice of weather variables in heat epidemiology studies.},

abstract = {Just as translational medicine follows a long winding path from bench-to-bedside, so can Evidence-Based Medicine be envisioned as comprising a multi-step pipeline, from building evidence from raw data through synthesizing best practices and providing clinical decision support in a process described as the "evidence pyramid". 1 At one end, a heterogeneous mix of clinical and experimental studies including clinical trials, case reports, animal models and retrospective analyses are published as new knowledge. Then, experts collect and assess high-quality relevant evidence on specific issues and publish their conclusions (e.g., regarding efficacy and safety of treatments) as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Finally, when an expert consensus has been reached, this must reach the attention of policy makers within the profession, the government and insurance companies, resulting in new practice guidelines and altered clinical practice within hospitals and clinics. At each stage, this process requires a large investment of time and effort from many individuals with a wide range of expertise. Our panel will discuss the variety of innovative approaches that are being taken by different informatics research groups to improve each step within the evidence based medicine pipeline. These approaches are, in part, devoted to making existing data collection and synthesis practices faster and more efficient, but they also involve re-imagining and re-engineering the processes by which evidence is accumulated, evaluated and applied.},

The approach can be highly sensitive and selective when a sensing material that reacts specifically with the analyte is found, but the specific reaction is usually accompanied by slow recovery and irreversibility, making continuous monitoring of air quality difficult. Consequently, colorimetry is often one-time only and single-point measurement. To overcome the difficulty, the present work reports a combined microfluidic and colorimetric approach that measures time evolution of a color gradient along a microfluidic channel via a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imager. The change of the color gradient provides continuous monitoring of the analyte concentration over many hours, and the principle and capability of the approach is demonstrated by theoretical simulation, and experimental validation with real samples.},

abstract = {The use of biometric sensors for monitoring an individual’s health and related behaviors, continuously and in real time, promises to revolutionize healthcare in the near future. In an effort to better understand the complex interplay between one’s medical condition and social, environmental, and metabolic parameters, this article presents the KNOWME platform, a complete, end-to-end, body area sensing system that integrates off-the-shelf biometric sensors with a Nokia N95 mobile phone to continuously monitor the metabolic signals of a subject. With a current focus on pediatric obesity, KNOWME employs metabolic signals to monitor and evaluate physical activity. KNOWME development and in-lab deployment studies have revealed three major challenges: (1) the need for robustness to highly varying operating environments due to subject-induced variability, such as mobility or sensor placement; (2) balancing the tension between achieving high fidelity data collection and minimizing network energy consumption; and (3) accurate physical activity detection using a modest number of sensors. The KNOWME platform described herein directly addresses these three challenges. Design robustness is achieved by creating a three-tiered sensor data collection architecture. The system architecture is designed to provide robust, continuous, multichannel data collection and scales without compromising normal mobile device operation. Novel physical activity detection methods which exploit new representations of sensor signals provide accurate and efficient physical activity detection. The physical activity detection method employs personalized training phases and accounts for intersession variability. Finally, exploiting the features of the hardware implementation, a low-complexity sensor sampling algorithm is developed, resulting in significant energy savings without loss of performance.},

Emerging water sensing systems, however, can provide detailed usage data at the level of individual water fixtures (i.e., disaggregated usage data). In this paper, we perform formative evaluations of two sets of novel eco-feedback displays that take advantage of this disaggregated data. The first display set isolates and examines specific elements of an eco-feedback design space such as data and time granularity. Displays in the second set act as design probes to elicit reactions about competition, privacy, and integration into domestic space. The displays were evaluated via an online survey of 651 North American respondents and in-home, semi-structured interviews with 10 families (20 adults). Our findings are relevant not only to the design of future water eco-feedback systems but also for other types of consumption (e.g., electricity and gas).},

These mobile health (mHealth) devices can produce tremendous amounts of location-rich, real-time, high-frequency data. Unfortunately, these data are often full of bias, noise, variability, and gaps. Robust tools and techniques have not yet been developed to make mHealth data more meaningful to patients and clinicians. To be most useful, health data should be sharable across multiple mHealth applications and connected to electronic health records. The lack of data sharing and dearth of tools and techniques for making sense of health data are critical bottlenecks limiting the impact of mHealth to improve health outcomes. We describe Open mHealth, a nonprofit organization that is building an open software architecture to address these data sharing and "sense-making" bottlenecks. Our architecture consists of open source software modules with well-defined interfaces using a minimal set of common metadata. An initial set of modules, called InfoVis, has been developed for data analysis and visualization. A second set of modules, our Personal Evidence Architecture, will support scientific inferences from mHealth data. These Personal Evidence Architecture modules will include standardized, validated clinical measures to support novel evaluation methods, such as n-of-1 studies. All of Open mHealth's modules are designed to be reusable across multiple applications, disease conditions, and user populations to maximize impact and flexibility. We are also building an open community of developers and health innovators, modeled after the open approach taken in the initial growth of the Internet, to foster meaningful cross-disciplinary collaboration around new tools and techniques. An open mHealth community and architecture will catalyze increased mHealth efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare a technology-based system, an in-person behavioral weight loss intervention, and a combination of both over a 6-month period in overweight adults. Fifty-one subjects (age: 44.2 ± 8.7 years, BMI: 33.7 ± 3.6 kg/m(2)) participated in a 6-month behavioral weight loss program and were randomized to one of three groups: standard behavioral weight loss (SBWL), SBWL plus technology-based system (SBWL+TECH), or technology-based system only (TECH). All groups reduced caloric intake and progressively increased moderate intensity physical activity. SBWL and SBWL+TECH attended weekly meetings. SBWL+TECH also received a TECH that included an energy monitoring armband and website to monitor energy intake and expenditure. TECH used the technology system and received monthly telephone calls. Body weight and physical activity were assessed at 0 and 6 months. Retention at 6 months was significantly different (P = 0.005) between groups (SBWL: 53{\%}, SBWL+TECH: 100{\%}, and TECH: 77{\%}). Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis revealed significant weight losses at 6 months in SBWL+TECH (-8.8 ± 5.0 kg, -8.7 ± 4.7{\%}), SBWL (-3.7 ± 5.7 kg, -4.1 ± 6.3{\%}), and TECH (-5.8 ± 6.6 kg, -6.3 ± 7.1{\%}) (P < 0.001). Self-report physical activity increased significantly in SBWL (473.9 ± 800.7 kcal/week), SBWL+TECH (713.9 ± 1,278.8 kcal/week), and TECH (1,066.2 ± 1,371 kcal/week) (P < 0.001), with no differences between groups (P = 0.25). The TECH used in conjunction with monthly telephone calls, produced similar, if not greater weight losses and changes in physical activity than the standard in-person behavioral program at 6 months. The use of this technology may provide an effective short-term clinical alternative to standard in-person behavioral weight loss interventions, with the longer term effects warranting investigation.},

abstract = {Despite significant gains by pediatric collaborative improvement networks, the overall US system of chronic illness care does not work well. A new paradigm is needed: a Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N). A C3N is a network-based production system that harnesses the collective intelligence of patients, clinicians, and researchers and distributes the production of knowledge, information, and know-how over large groups of people, dramatically accelerating the discovery process. A C3N is a platform of "operating systems" on which interconnected processes and interventions are designed, tested, and implemented. The social operating system is facilitated by community building, engaging all stakeholders and their expertise, and providing multiple ways to participate. Standard progress measures and a robust information technology infrastructure enable the technical operating system to reduce unwanted variation and adopt advances more rapidly. A structured approach to innovation design provides a scientific operating system or "laboratory" for what works and how to make it work. Data support testing and research on multiple levels: comparative effectiveness research for populations, evaluating care delivery processes at the care center level, and N-of-1 trials and other methods to select the best treatment of individual patient circumstances. Methods to reduce transactional costs to participate include a Federated IRB Model in which centers rely on a protocol approved at 1 central institutional review board and a "commons framework" for organizational copyright and intellectual property concerns. A fully realized C3N represents a discontinuous leap to a self-developing learning health system capable of producing a qualitatively different approach to improving health.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are a promising channel for delivering just-in-time guidance and support for improving key daily health behaviors. Despite an explosion of mobile phone applications aimed at physical activity and other health behaviors, few have been based on theoretically derived constructs and empirical evidence. Eighty adults ages 45 years and older who were insufficiently physically active, engaged in prolonged daily sitting, and were new to smartphone technology, participated in iterative design development and feasibility testing of three daily activity smartphone applications based on motivational frames drawn from behavioral science theory and evidence. An "analytically" framed custom application focused on personalized goal setting, self-monitoring, and active problem solving around barriers to behavior change. A "socially" framed custom application focused on social comparisons, norms, and support. An "affectively" framed custom application focused on operant conditioning principles of reinforcement scheduling and emotional transference to an avatar, whose movements and behaviors reflected the physical activity and sedentary levels of the user. To explore the applications' initial efficacy in changing regular physical activity and leisure-time sitting, behavioral changes were assessed across eight weeks in 68 participants using the CHAMPS physical activity questionnaire and the Australian sedentary behavior questionnaire. User acceptability of and satisfaction with the applications was explored via a post-intervention user survey. The results indicated that the three applications were sufficiently robust to significantly improve regular moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity and decrease leisure-time sitting during the 8-week behavioral adoption period. Acceptability of the applications was confirmed in the post-intervention surveys for this sample of midlife and older adults new to smartphone technology. Preliminary data exploring sustained use of the applications across a longer time period yielded promising results. The results support further systematic investigation of the efficacy of the applications for changing these key health-promoting behaviors.},

abstract = {The concepts of "self-tracking" and "the quantified self" have recently begun to emerge in discussions of how best to optimize one's life. These concepts refer to the practice of gathering data about oneself on a regular basis and then recording and analyzing the data to produce statistics and other data (such as images) relating to one's bodily functions and everyday habits. Some self-trackers collect data on only one or two dimensions of their lives, and only for a short time. Others may do so for hundreds of phenomena and for long periods.The tracking and analysis of aspects of one's self and one's body are not new practices. People have been recording their habits and health-related metrics for centuries as part of attempts at self-reflection and self-improvement. What is indisputably new is the term “the quantified self” and its associated movement, which includes a dedicated website with that title, and regular meetings and conferences, as well as the novel ways of self-tracking using digital technologies that have developed in recent years. A growing range of digital devices with associated apps are now available for self-tracking. Many of these devicescan be worn on or close to the body to measure elements of the user's everyday life and activities and produce data that can be recorded and monitored by the user. They include not only digital cameras, smartphones, tablet computers, watches, wireless weight scales, and blood pressure monitors, but also wearable bands or patches, clip-on devices and jewelry with embedded sensors able to measure bodily functions or movement and upload data wirelessly. In many of these devices global positioning devices, gyroscopes, altimeters, and accelerometers provide spatial location and quantify movement. These technologies allow self-trackers to collect data on their moods, diet, dreams, social encounters, posture, sexual activity, blood chemistry, heart rate, body temperature, exercise patterns, brain- function, alcohol, coffee and tobacco consumption, and many other variables.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) ambulatory disease management programs appear to offer the greatest benefit to HF patients at highest risk, defined as having New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class III or IV symptoms. The Latitude Patient Management System is the first HF management tool to use wireless telemetry present in a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device that is linked to remotely collect blood pressure and weight measures, permitting a single transmission reporting device data. Potential advantages of this system include ease of data transmissions, correlation among measures of HF status, arrhythmic events, and device performance. However, the use and ultimate utility of these combined features for patient management are untested.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The Remote Active Monitoring in Patients with Heart Failure (RAPID-RF) study is a multicenter registry that will enroll up to 1000 patients on the Latitude Patient Management System from approximately 100 centers. The primary objective is to examine physician responses to Latitude Active Monitoring data alerts by assessing alert-related medical interventions. Minimum follow-up will be 3 months after implant with a maximum follow-up time of 24 months after implant.

CONCLUSIONS: The RAPID-RF study will provide important preliminary data on how remotely collected HF and arrhythmic surveillance data alter the management of HF patients with CRT-D devices.},

abstract = {Background: Active travel is an important area in physical activity research, but objective measurement of active travel is still difficult. Automated methods to measure travel behaviors will improve research in this area. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning method for transportation mode prediction from global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer data. Methods: We collected a dataset of about 150 h of GPS and accelerometer data from two research assistants following a protocol of prescribed trips consisting of five activities: bicycling, riding in a vehicle, walking, sitting, and standing. We extracted 49 features from 1-min windows of this data. We compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms and chose a random forest algorithm to classify the transportation mode. We used a moving average output filter to smooth the output predictions over time. Results: The random forest algorithm achieved 89.8{\%} cross-validated accuracy on this dataset. Adding the moving average filter to smooth output predictions increased the cross-validated accuracy to 91.9{\%}. Conclusion: Machine learning methods are a viable approach for automating measurement of active travel, particularly for measuring travel activities that traditional accelerometer data processing methods misclassify, such as bicycling and vehicle travel.},

abstract = {Project HealthDesign, a multi-year, multi-site project sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with additional support from the California HealthCare Foundation, is designed to stimulate innovation in personal health records (PHRs). Project HealthDesign teams employed user-centered design processes to create designs and prototypes of computer-based applications to support and enhance human health for a wide range of patients, from children with chronic health conditions to elders transitioning from hospital to home. A program design philosophy encouraged designers to envision PHRs as a suite of personal health information management tools, or applications, separate from, but drawing upon, personal health data from a variety of sources. In addition to information contained in one's medical record, these personal health data included patient-supplied clinical parameters such as blood glucose and daily weights; as well as patient-generated observations of daily living (ODLs) - the unique, idiosyncratic cues, such as sleep adequacy or confidence in self care, that inform patients about their abilities to manage health challenges and take healthy action. A common technical platform provided infrastructure services such as data standards and identity-management protocols, and helped to demonstrate a scalable, efficient approach to user-centered design of personal health information management systems. The program's ethical, legal and social issues consultancy identified challenges to acceleration of action-focused PHRs: personal control of privacy choices, management of privacy in home conditions, and rebalancing power structures in shared decision making.},

abstract = {Introduction: Despite the known advantages of objective physical activity monitors (e.g., accelerometers), these devices have high rates of non-wear, which leads to missing data. Objective activity monitors are also unable to capture valuable contextual information about behavior. Adolescents recruited into physical activity surveillance and intervention studies will increasingly have smartphones, which are miniature computers with built-in motion sensors. Methods: This paper describes the design and development of a smartphone application (“app”) called Mobile Teen that combines objective and self-report assessment strategies through (1) sensor-informed context-sensitive ecological momentary assessment (CS-EMA) and (2) sensor-assisted end-of-day recall.Results: The Mobile Teen app uses the mobile phone’s built-in motion sensor to automatically detect likely bouts of phone non-wear, sedentary behavior, and physical activity. The app then uses transitions between these inferred states to trigger CS-EMA self-report surveys measuring the type, purpose, and context of activity in real time. The end of the day recall component of the Mobile Teen app allows users to interactively review and label their own physical activity data each evening using visual cues from automatically-detected major activity transitions from the phone’s built-in motions sensors. Major activity transitions are identified by the app, which cues the user to label that “chunk,” or period, of time using activity categories.Conclusions: Sensor-driven CS-EMA and end-of-day recall smartphone apps can be used to augment physical activity data collected by objective activity monitors, filling in gaps during non-wear bouts and providing additional real-time data on environmental, social, and emotional correlates of behavior. Smartphone apps such as these have potential for affordable deployment in large scale epidemiological and intervention studies.},

We provide the rationale, design, and preliminary data from 3 ongoing clinical trials of mobile interventions developed for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Project 1 used a personal digital assistant to prompt engagement in personalized self-management behaviors based on real-time data. Project 2 employed experience sampling through text messages to facilitate case management. Project 3 was built on group functional skills training for schizophrenia by incorporating between-session mobile phone contacts with therapists. Preliminary findings were of minimal participant attrition, and no broken devices; yet, several operational and technical barriers needed to be addressed. Adherence was similar to that reported in nonpsychiatric populations, with high participant satisfaction. Therefore, mobile devices seem feasible and acceptable in augmenting psychosocial interventions for severe mental illness, with future research in establishing efficacy, cost effectiveness, and ethical and safety protocols.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A technical expert panel convened by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institute of Mental Health was charged with reviewing the state of research on behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) in mental health and identifying the top research priorities. BITs refers to behavioral and psychological interventions that use information and communication technology features to address behavioral and mental health outcomes.

METHOD: This study on the findings of the technical expert panel.

RESULTS: Videoconferencing and standard telephone technologies to deliver psychotherapy have been well validated. Web-based interventions have shown efficacy across a broad range of mental health outcomes. Social media such as online support groups have produced disappointing outcomes when used alone. Mobile technologies have received limited attention for mental health outcomes. Virtual reality has shown good efficacy for anxiety and pediatric disorders. Serious gaming has received little work in mental health.

CONCLUSION: Research focused on understanding reach, adherence, barriers and cost is recommended. Improvements in the collection, storage, analysis and visualization of big data will be required. New theoretical models and evaluation strategies will be required. Finally, for BITs to have a public health impact, research on implementation and application to prevention is required.},

For example, there are three behavioral risk factors-tobacco use, poor diet, and inactivity-that contribute to four chronic diseases: heart disease, type 2 diabetes, lung disease, and some cancers. Together, these behaviors account for more than 50{\%} of preventable deaths (see the Web site 3four50.com).

Technologies that have the potential to improve the quality of mental health services are developing at a phenomenal rate. In the current paper, experts from a wide array of disciplines and settings share their perspectives, experiences, and visions for technology-assisted assessment and treatment of serious mental illness in the present and not-too-distant future. First, we examine how technological advancements may help consumers better understand and utilize complex treatment systems, obtain information on mental health conditions and viable interventions, enhance treatment engagement, learn and maintain effective coping strategies, overcome some of the barriers associated with stigma, reduce treatment costs, and increase treatment access and outcomes.

abstract = {A field of personal analytics has emerged around self-monitoring practices, which includes the visualization and interpretation of the data produced. This paper explores personal analytics from the perspective of self-optimization, arguing that the ways in which people confront and engage with visualized personal data are as significant as the technology itself. The paper leans on the concept of the “data double”: the conversion of human bodies and minds into data flows that can be figuratively reassembled for the purposes of personal reflection and interaction. Based on an empirical study focusing on heart-rate variability measurement, the discussion underlines that a distanced theorizing of personal analytics is not sufficient if one wants to capture affective encounters between humans and their data doubles. Research outcomes suggest that these explanations can produce permanence and stability while also profoundly changing ways in which people reflect on themselves, on others and on their daily lives.},

abstract = {Recent developments in our ability to capture, curate, and analyze data, the field of data-intensive science (DIS), have indeed made these interesting and challenging times for scientific practice as well as policy making in real time. We are confronted with immense datasets that challenge our ability to pool, transfer, analyze, or interpret scientific observations. We have more data available than ever before, yet more questions to be answered as well, and no clear path to answer them. We are excited by the potential for science-based solutions to humankind's problems, yet stymied by the limitations of our current cyberinfrastructure and existing public policies. Importantly, DIS signals a transformation of the hypothesis-driven tradition of science ("first hypothesize, then experiment") to one that is typified by "first experiment, then hypothesize" mode of discovery. Another hallmark of DIS is that it amasses data that are public goods (i.e., creates a "commons") that can further be creatively mined for various applications in different sectors. As such, this calls for a science policy vision that is long term. We herein reflect on how best to approach to policy making at this critical inflection point when DIS applications are being diversified in agriculture, ecology, marine biology, and environmental research internationally. This article outlines the key policy issues and gaps that emerged from the multidisciplinary discussions at the NSF-funded DIS workshop held at the Seattle Children's Research Institute in Seattle, on September 19-20, 2010.},

abstract = {Rapid advances in DNA sequencing promise to enable new diagnostics and individualized therapies. Achieving personalized medicine, however, will require extensive research on highly reidentifiable, integrated datasets of genomic and health information. To assist with this, participants in the Personal Genome Project choose to forgo privacy via our institutional review board- approved "open consent" process. The contribution of public data and samples facilitates both scientific discovery and standardization of methods. We present our findings after enrollment of more than 1,800 participants, including whole-genome sequencing of 10 pilot participant genomes (the PGP-10). We introduce the Genome-Environment-Trait Evidence (GET-Evidence) system. This tool automatically processes genomes and prioritizes both published and novel variants for interpretation. In the process of reviewing the presumed healthy PGP-10 genomes, we find numerous literature references implying serious disease. Although it is sometimes impossible to rule out a late-onset effect, stringent evidence requirements can address the high rate of incidental findings. To that end we develop a peer production system for recording and organizing variant evaluations according to standard evidence guidelines, creating a public forum for reaching consensus on interpretation of clinically relevant variants. Genome analysis becomes a two-step process: using a prioritized list to record variant evaluations, then automatically sorting reviewed variants using these annotations. Genome data, health and trait information, participant samples, and variant interpretations are all shared in the public domain-we invite others to review our results using our participant samples and contribute to our interpretations. We offer our public resource and methods to further personalized medical research.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Using the prediction of cancer outcome as a model, we have tested the hypothesis that through analysing routinely collected digital data contained in an electronic administrative record (EAR), using machine-learning techniques, we could enhance conventional methods in predicting clinical outcomes.

SETTING: A regional cancer centre in Australia.

PARTICIPANTS: Disease-specific data from a purpose-built cancer registry (Evaluation of Cancer Outcomes (ECO)) from 869 patients were used to predict survival at 6, 12 and 24 months. The model was validated with data from a further 94 patients, and results compared to the assessment of five specialist oncologists. Machine-learning prediction using ECO data was compared with that using EAR and a model combining ECO and EAR data.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival prediction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

RESULTS: The ECO model yielded AUCs of 0.87 (95{\%} CI 0.848 to 0.890) at 6 months, 0.796 (95{\%} CI 0.774 to 0.823) at 12 months and 0.764 (95{\%} CI 0.737 to 0.789) at 24 months. Each was slightly better than the performance of the clinician panel. The model performed consistently across a range of cancers, including rare cancers. Combining ECO and EAR data yielded better prediction than the ECO-based model (AUCs ranging from 0.757 to 0.997 for 6 months, AUCs from 0.689 to 0.988 for 12 months and AUCs from 0.713 to 0.973 for 24 months). The best prediction was for genitourinary, head and neck, lung, skin, and upper gastrointestinal tumours.

CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning applied to information from a disease-specific (cancer) database and the EAR can be used to predict clinical outcomes. Importantly, the approach described made use of digital data that is already routinely collected but underexploited by clinical health systems.},

Benefits include cost effectiveness, potential for real-time data collection, feedback capability, minimized participant burden, relevance to multiple types of populations, and increased dissemination capability. However, these advantages are coupled with unique challenges. This commentary discusses challenges with using mHealth strategies for child obesity prevention, such as lack of scientific evidence base describing effectiveness of commercially available applications; relatively slower speed of technology development in academic research settings as compared with industry; data security, and patient privacy; potentially adverse consequences of increased sedentary screen time, and decreased focused attention due to technology use. Implications for researchers include development of more nuanced measures of screen time and other technology-related activities, and partnering with industry for developing healthier technologies. Implications for health practitioners include monitoring, assessing, and providing feedback to child obesity program designers about users' data transfer issues, perceived security and privacy, sedentary behavior, focused attention, and maintenance of behavior change. Implications for policy makers include regulation of claims and quality of apps (especially those aimed at children), supporting standardized data encryption and secure open architecture, and resources for research-industry partnerships that improve the look and feel of technology. Partnerships between academia and industry may promote solutions, as discussed in this commentary.},

This is accompanied by a perhaps more fundamental problem of deficit, bias, and lack of integration of aspects concerning the human side of the QS idea. The step that the authors tried to make in this chapter is to highlight aspects that could lead to a more robust approach in QS area. This was done, primarily, through a new approach in data visualization and, secondly, through a necessary management of complexity, both in technological terms and, for what concerns the human side of the whole issue, in theoretical terms.

abstract = {Data on health and wellness from around the world reveal a pattern of less than optimal outcomes for the young and old alike. These results are not limited to the developing world. In fact, a recent report showed that Americans die sooner and experience higher rates of disease and injury than people in other high-income countries [1]. Although the precise causes of these disparities are not fully elucidated, chronic diseases, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and lung disease, are increasing in the Western world. Similarly, in the low- and middle-income countries, chronic disease is increasingly being cited as an emerging problem and a major component of disease burden [2]. It is widely suspected that the increased prevalence of unhealthy behaviors plays a significant role in overall health and in chronic disease. Indeed, it has been estimated that approximately 40{\%} of all premature deaths are due to behavioral patterns that are potentially modifiable [3]. Further, in patients suffering from chronic disease, self-management of health behaviors (e.g., eating well, exercising as indicated, and taking medication as directed) has been shown to have a significant effect on symptom reduction and quality of life, as well as reducing costs in the health-care system [4]. Finally, enhancing health behavior to prevent disease has been consistently shown to decrease adverse health events over time. Thus, the dangerous effects of inactivity, poor diet, smoking, drug and alcohol use, lack of sleep, and chronically stressful environments are now widely appreciated to be associated with not only the quality of life but also with mortality and health-care and disability costs.},

abstract = {Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) represent an emerging technology which has received much attention recently due to its enormous potential to enable remote, real-time, continuous and non-invasive monitoring of people in health-care, entertainment, fitness, sport, social interaction. Signal processing for BSNs usually comprises of multiple levels of data abstraction, from raw sensor data to data calculated from processing steps such as feature extraction and classification. This paper presents a multi-layer task model based on the concept of Virtual Sensors to improve architecture modularity and design reusability. Virtual Sensors are abstractions of components of BSN systems that include sensor sampling and processing tasks and provide data upon external requests. The Virtual Sensor model implementation relies on SPINE2, an open source domain-specific framework that is designed to support distributed sensing operations and signal processing for wireless sensor networks and enables code reusability, efficiency, and application interoperability. The proposed model is applied in the context of gait analysis through wearable sensors. A gait analysis system is developed according to a SPINE2-based Virtual Sensor architecture and experimentally evaluated. Obtained results confirm that great effectiveness can be achieved in designing and implementing BSN applications through the Virtual Sensor approach while maintaining high efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract = {Students of social evolution are concerned not only with the general course it has followed, but also with the mechanisms that have brought it about. One such mechanism comes into play when the quantitative increase in some entity, usually population, reaching a certain threshold, gives rise to a qualitative change in the structure of a society. This mechanism, first recognized by Hegel, was seized on by Marx and Engels. However, neither they nor their current followers among anthropologists have made much use of it in attempting to explain social evolution. But as this paper attempts to show, in those few instances when the mechanism has been invoked, it has heightened our understanding of the process of social evolution. And, it is argued, if the mechanism were more widely applied, further understanding of the course of evolution could be expected to result.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation programmes delivered via mobile phone text messaging show increases in self-reported quitting in the short term. We assessed the effect of an automated smoking cessation programme delivered via mobile phone text messaging on continuous abstinence, which was biochemically verified at 6 months.

METHODS: In this single-blind, randomised trial, undertaken in the UK, smokers willing to make a quit attempt were randomly allocated, using an independent telephone randomisation system, to a mobile phone text messaging smoking cessation programme (txt2stop), comprising motivational messages and behavioural-change support, or to a control group that received text messages unrelated to quitting. The system automatically generated intervention or control group texts according to the allocation. Outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous smoking abstinence, biochemically verified at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 80978588.

FINDINGS: We assessed 11,914 participants for eligibility. 5800 participants were randomised, of whom 2915 smokers were allocated to the txt2stop intervention and 2885 were allocated to the control group; eight were excluded because they were randomised more than once. Primary outcome data were available for 5524 (95{\%}) participants. Biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months was significantly increased in the txt2stop group (10·7{\%} txt2stop vs 4·9{\%} control, relative risk [RR] 2·20, 95{\%} CI 1·80-2·68; p<0·0001). Similar results were obtained when participants that were lost to follow-up were treated as smokers (268 [9{\%}] of 2911 txt2stop vs 124 [4{\%}] of 2881 control [RR 2·14, 95{\%} CI 1·74-2·63; p<0·0001]), and when they were excluded (268 [10{\%}] of 2735 txt2stop vs 124 [4{\%}] of 2789 control [2·20, 1·79-2·71; p<0·0001]). No significant heterogeneity was shown in any of the prespecified subgroups.

INTERPRETATION: The txt2stop smoking cessation programme significantly improved smoking cessation rates at 6 months and should be considered for inclusion in smoking cessation services.

abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

abstract = {Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder, characterised by the long-term propensity of addicted individuals to relapse. A major factor that obstructs the attainment of abstinence is the persistence of maladaptive drug-associated memories, which can maintain drug-seeking and taking behaviour and promote unconscious relapse of these habits. Thus, addiction can be conceptualised as a disorder of aberrant learning of the formation of strong instrumental memories linking actions to drug-seeking and taking outcomes that ultimately are expressed as persistent stimulus-response habits; of previously neutral environmental stimuli that become associated with drug highs (and/or withdrawal states) through pavlovian conditioning, and of the subsequent interactions between pavlovian and instrumental memories to influence relapse behaviour. Understanding the psychological, neurobiological and molecular basis of these drug memories may produce new methods of pro-abstinence, anti-relapse treatments for addiction.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Fifty-eight pathological gamblers receiving treatment for addictive illness in two South Dakota hospitals were assessed for types of gambling and grouped into three categories; 15 "video lottery only" (VLO), 36 "video lottery mixed" (VLM), and 7 "not video lottery" (NVL). There were 51 male and 7 female respondents, with a mean age of 38.2. We hypothesized that video lottery would be the predominant type of gambling on several dimensions: level of recent activity, most money lost on one occasion, and number of DSM-IV criteria met. Of all gamblers, 87.9{\%} had pathological involvement with video lottery. Video lottery gambling accounted for the highest level of recent activity. In the VLM group, video lottery gambling led to greater single-occasion monetary losses. In addition, significantly more DSM-IV criteria were met in the VLM group for video lottery gambling than for other forms of gambling these subjects had engaged in. Results indicate that video lottery gambling is the predominant type of gambling behavior engaged in by gamblers seeking treatment for addictive illness in South Dakota. We propose that these findings could be associated with the availability and stimulus differences between video lottery and other gambling types.},

abstract = {Instrumental behavior can be controlled by goal-directed action-outcome and habitual stimulus-response processes that are supported by anatomically distinct brain systems. Based on previous findings showing that stress modulates the interaction of "cognitive" and "habit" memory systems, we asked in the presented study whether stress may coordinate goal-directed and habit processes in instrumental learning. For this purpose, participants were exposed to stress (socially evaluated cold pressor test) or a control condition before they were trained to perform two instrumental actions that were associated with two distinct food outcomes. After training, one of these food outcomes was selectively devalued as subjects were saturated with that food. Next, subjects were presented the two instrumental actions in extinction. Stress before training in the instrumental task rendered participants' behavior insensitive to the change in the value of the food outcomes, that is stress led to habit performance. Moreover, stress reduced subjects' explicit knowledge of the action-outcome contingencies. These results demonstrate for the first time that stress promotes habits at the expense of goal-directed performance in humans.},

abstract = {Drug addiction is increasingly viewed as the endpoint of a series of transitions from initial drug use--when a drug is voluntarily taken because it has reinforcing, often hedonic, effects--through loss of control over this behavior, such that it becomes habitual and ultimately compulsive. Here we discuss evidence that these transitions depend on interactions between pavlovian and instrumental learning processes. We hypothesize that the change from voluntary drug use to more habitual and compulsive drug use represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior as well as a progression from ventral to more dorsal domains of the striatum, involving its dopaminergic innervation. These neural transitions may themselves depend on the neuroplasticity in both cortical and striatal structures that is induced by chronic self-administration of drugs.},

abstract = {Pathological gambling (PG) shares clinical characteristics with substance-use disorders and is thus discussed as a behavioral addiction. Recent neuroimaging studies on PG report functional changes in prefrontal structures and the mesolimbic reward system. While an imbalance between these structures has been related to addictive behavior, whether their dysfunction in PG is reflected in the interaction between them remains unclear. We addressed this question using functional connectivity resting-state fMRI in male subjects with PG and controls. Seed-based functional connectivity was computed using two regions-of-interest, based on the results of a previous voxel-based morphometry study, located in the prefrontal cortex and the mesolimbic reward system (right middle frontal gyrus and right ventral striatum). PG patients demonstrated increased connectivity from the right middle frontal gyrus to the right striatum as compared to controls, which was also positively correlated with nonplanning aspect of impulsiveness, smoking and craving scores in the PG group. Moreover, PG patients demonstrated decreased connectivity from the right middle frontal gyrus to other prefrontal areas as compared to controls. The right ventral striatum demonstrated increased connectivity to the right superior and middle frontal gyrus and left cerebellum in PG patients as compared to controls. The increased connectivity to the cerebellum was positively correlated with smoking in the PG group. Our results provide further evidence for alterations in functional connectivity in PG with increased connectivity between prefrontal regions and the reward system, similar to connectivity changes reported in substance use disorder.},

abstract = {The recent increase in the use of digital self-tracking devices has given rise to a range of relations to the self often discussed as quantified self (QS). In popular and academic discourse, this development has been discussed variously as a form of narcissistic self-involvement, an advanced expression of panoptical self-surveillance and a potential new dawn for e-health. This article proposes a previously un-theorised consequence of this large-scale observation and analysis of human behaviour; that exercise activity is in the process of being reconfigured as labour. QS will be briefly introduced, and reflected on, subsequently considering some of its key aspects in relation to how these have so far been interpreted and analysed in academic literature. Secondly, the analysis of scholars of “digital labour” and “immaterial labour” will be considered, which will be discussed in relation to what its analysis of the transformations of work in contemporary advanced capitalism can offer to an interpretation of the promotion and management of 
the self-tracking of exercise activities. Building on this analysis, it will be proposed that a thermodynamic model of the exploitation of potential energy underlies the interest that corporations have shown in self-tracking and that “gamification” and the promotion of an entrepreneurial selfhood is the ideological frame that informs the strategy through which labour value is extracted without payment. Finally, the potential theoretical and political consequences of these insights will be considered.},

I propose one solution to this paradox: People experience an emotion when they conceptualize an instance of affective feeling. In this view, the experience of emotion is an act of categorization, guided by embodied knowledge about emotion. The result is a model of emotion experience that has much in common with the social psychological literature on person perception and with literature on embodied conceptual knowledge as it has recently been applied to social psychology.},

abstract = {AIMS: This document provides health care professionals involved in initiating and monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy with guidelines for the provision of safe and effective patient self-testing/patient self-management of oral anticoagulation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The consensus group has critically reviewed the literature and compared the results of usual care (UC) vs. anticoagulation clinic and patient self-management/patient self-testing (PSM/PST). The education and training of patients for self-monitoring are described, together with the suitability of patients, the effect on quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The consensus agrees that patient self-testing and patient self-management are effective methods of monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy, providing outcomes at least as good as, and possibly better than, those achieved with an anticoagulation clinic. All patients must be appropriately selected and trained. Currently available self-testing/self-management devices give INR results which are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing. The most frequent testing frequency is weekly but lower frequency of testing can be justified based on institutional or patient conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: The consensus agrees that there are several points in favour of PST/PSM, for example, a higher degree of medical safety, increased patient education, improved response to changes in lifestyle, increased independence for the patient and improved quality of life.},

abstract = {The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "time-reversing" well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed.},

abstract = {Pathological gambling (PG) shares clinical characteristics with substance-use disorders and is thus discussed as a behavioral addiction. Recent neuroimaging studies on PG report functional changes in prefrontal structures and the mesolimbic reward system. While an imbalance between these structures has been related to addictive behavior, whether their dysfunction in PG is reflected in the interaction between them remains unclear. We addressed this question using functional connectivity resting-state fMRI in male subjects with PG and controls. Seed-based functional connectivity was computed using two regions-of-interest, based on the results of a previous voxel-based morphometry study, located in the prefrontal cortex and the mesolimbic reward system (right middle frontal gyrus and right ventral striatum). PG patients demonstrated increased connectivity from the right middle frontal gyrus to the right striatum as compared to controls, which was also positively correlated with nonplanning aspect of impulsiveness, smoking and craving scores in the PG group. Moreover, PG patients demonstrated decreased connectivity from the right middle frontal gyrus to other prefrontal areas as compared to controls. The right ventral striatum demonstrated increased connectivity to the right superior and middle frontal gyrus and left cerebellum in PG patients as compared to controls. The increased connectivity to the cerebellum was positively correlated with smoking in the PG group. Our results provide further evidence for alterations in functional connectivity in PG with increased connectivity between prefrontal regions and the reward system, similar to connectivity changes reported in substance use disorder.},

Experiments involved decisions to drink a disgusting liquid for scientific purposes (Experiment 1), tutor peers during exam week (Experiment 2), receive e-mails for charity (Experiment 3), and defer a lottery prize for a larger one (Experiment 4). These findings seemed to be at least partially rooted in the tendency for decisions regarding the ongoing, present self to be uniquely influenced by internal subjective experience. Specifically, these effects emerged for real, but not hypothetical, decisions. Also, they were mitigated by manipulations that altered participants' attention to present or future subjective experience. In addition, when participants' subjective experience primarily involved empathy for others (Experiment 3), their decisions on behalf of present selves were more generous than their decisions for future selves and others. Applications are discussed.},

abstract = {The recent increase in the use of digital self-tracking devices has given rise to a range of relations to the self often discussed as quantified self (QS). In popular and academic discourse, this development has been discussed variously as a form of narcissistic self-involvement, an advanced expression of panoptical self-surveillance and a potential new dawn for e-health. This article proposes a previously un-theorised consequence of this large-scale observation and analysis of human behaviour; that exercise activity is in the process of being reconfigured as labour. QS will be briefly introduced, and reflected on, subsequently considering some of its key aspects in relation to how these have so far been interpreted and analysed in academic literature. Secondly, the analysis of scholars of “digital labour” and “immaterial labour” will be considered, which will be discussed in relation to what its analysis of the transformations of work in contemporary advanced capitalism can offer to an interpretation of the promotion and management of 
the self-tracking of exercise activities. Building on this analysis, it will be proposed that a thermodynamic model of the exploitation of potential energy underlies the interest that corporations have shown in self-tracking and that “gamification” and the promotion of an entrepreneurial selfhood is the ideological frame that informs the strategy through which labour value is extracted without payment. Finally, the potential theoretical and political consequences of these insights will be considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation programmes delivered via mobile phone text messaging show increases in self-reported quitting in the short term. We assessed the effect of an automated smoking cessation programme delivered via mobile phone text messaging on continuous abstinence, which was biochemically verified at 6 months.

METHODS: In this single-blind, randomised trial, undertaken in the UK, smokers willing to make a quit attempt were randomly allocated, using an independent telephone randomisation system, to a mobile phone text messaging smoking cessation programme (txt2stop), comprising motivational messages and behavioural-change support, or to a control group that received text messages unrelated to quitting. The system automatically generated intervention or control group texts according to the allocation. Outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous smoking abstinence, biochemically verified at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 80978588.

FINDINGS: We assessed 11,914 participants for eligibility. 5800 participants were randomised, of whom 2915 smokers were allocated to the txt2stop intervention and 2885 were allocated to the control group; eight were excluded because they were randomised more than once. Primary outcome data were available for 5524 (95{\%}) participants. Biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 6 months was significantly increased in the txt2stop group (10·7{\%} txt2stop vs 4·9{\%} control, relative risk [RR] 2·20, 95{\%} CI 1·80-2·68; p<0·0001). Similar results were obtained when participants that were lost to follow-up were treated as smokers (268 [9{\%}] of 2911 txt2stop vs 124 [4{\%}] of 2881 control [RR 2·14, 95{\%} CI 1·74-2·63; p<0·0001]), and when they were excluded (268 [10{\%}] of 2735 txt2stop vs 124 [4{\%}] of 2789 control [2·20, 1·79-2·71; p<0·0001]). No significant heterogeneity was shown in any of the prespecified subgroups.

INTERPRETATION: The txt2stop smoking cessation programme significantly improved smoking cessation rates at 6 months and should be considered for inclusion in smoking cessation services.

The development of devices that will allow healthcare providers to track treatment adherence and monitor physiological parameters with exact precision raises important questions and concerns. The aim of this study is to interrogate the use of these new technological devices which allow for previously unavailable data to be recorded on an ongoing basis and transmitted via a tiny microchip inserted into the body. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, we analyze how this anatomo-political and bio-political instrument serves to discipline chronically ill individuals and govern the health of entire populations who suffer from chronic conditions. To support our analysis, this article comprises three sections. First, we provide an overview of treatment adherence and technotherapeutics. Then, we explain how technotherapeutics concern the government of bodies and conducts at the individual level and population level more generally. Lastly, we provide an example of how this analysis can be connected to routine nursing practice in the field of HIV.},

abstract = {Four experiments showed that the decisions people make for future selves and other people are similar to each other and different from their decisions for present selves. Experiments involved decisions to drink a disgusting liquid for scientific purposes (Experiment 1), tutor peers during exam week (Experiment 2), receive e-mails for charity (Experiment 3), and defer a lottery prize for a larger one (Experiment 4). These findings seemed to be at least partially rooted in the tendency for decisions regarding the ongoing, present self to be uniquely influenced by internal subjective experience. Specifically, these effects emerged for real, but not hypothetical, decisions. Also, they were mitigated by manipulations that altered participants' attention to present or future subjective experience. In addition, when participants' subjective experience primarily involved empathy for others (Experiment 3), their decisions on behalf of present selves were more generous than their decisions for future selves and others. Applications are discussed.},

abstract = {Instrumental behavior can be controlled by goal-directed action-outcome and habitual stimulus-response processes that are supported by anatomically distinct brain systems. Based on previous findings showing that stress modulates the interaction of "cognitive" and "habit" memory systems, we asked in the presented study whether stress may coordinate goal-directed and habit processes in instrumental learning. For this purpose, participants were exposed to stress (socially evaluated cold pressor test) or a control condition before they were trained to perform two instrumental actions that were associated with two distinct food outcomes. After training, one of these food outcomes was selectively devalued as subjects were saturated with that food. Next, subjects were presented the two instrumental actions in extinction. Stress before training in the instrumental task rendered participants' behavior insensitive to the change in the value of the food outcomes, that is stress led to habit performance. Moreover, stress reduced subjects' explicit knowledge of the action-outcome contingencies. These results demonstrate for the first time that stress promotes habits at the expense of goal-directed performance in humans.},

I propose one solution to this paradox: People experience an emotion when they conceptualize an instance of affective feeling. In this view, the experience of emotion is an act of categorization, guided by embodied knowledge about emotion. The result is a model of emotion experience that has much in common with the social psychological literature on person perception and with literature on embodied conceptual knowledge as it has recently been applied to social psychology.},

@article{Larsen2010,
abstract = {The growth rate of scientific publication has been studied from 1907 to 2007 using available data from a number of literature databases, including Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). Traditional scientific publishing, that is publication in peer-reviewed journals, is still increasing although there are big differences between fields. There are no indications that the growth rate has decreased in the last 50 years. At the same time publication using new channels, for example conference proceedings, open archives and home pages, is growing fast. The growth rate for SCI up to 2007 is smaller than for comparable databases. This means that SCI was covering a decreasing part of the traditional scientific literature. There are also clear indications that the coverage by SCI is especially low in some of the scientific areas with the highest growth rate, including computer science and engineering sciences. The role of conference proceedings, open access archives and publications published on the net is increasing, especially in scientific fields with high growth rates, but this has only partially been reflected in the databases. The new publication channels challenge the use of the big databases in measurements of scientific productivity or output and of the growth rate of science. Because of the declining coverage and this challenge it is problematic that SCI has been used and is used as the dominant source for science indicators based on publication and citation numbers. The limited data available for social sciences show that the growth rate in SSCI was remarkably low and indicate that the coverage by SSCI was declining over time. National Science Indicators from Thomson Reuters is based solely on SCI, SSCI and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). Therefore the declining coverage of the citation databases problematizes the use of this source.},

abstract = {Addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder, characterised by the long-term propensity of addicted individuals to relapse. A major factor that obstructs the attainment of abstinence is the persistence of maladaptive drug-associated memories, which can maintain drug-seeking and taking behaviour and promote unconscious relapse of these habits. Thus, addiction can be conceptualised as a disorder of aberrant learning of the formation of strong instrumental memories linking actions to drug-seeking and taking outcomes that ultimately are expressed as persistent stimulus-response habits; of previously neutral environmental stimuli that become associated with drug highs (and/or withdrawal states) through pavlovian conditioning, and of the subsequent interactions between pavlovian and instrumental memories to influence relapse behaviour. Understanding the psychological, neurobiological and molecular basis of these drug memories may produce new methods of pro-abstinence, anti-relapse treatments for addiction.},

abstract = {Students of social evolution are concerned not only with the general course it has followed, but also with the mechanisms that have brought it about. One such mechanism comes into play when the quantitative increase in some entity, usually population, reaching a certain threshold, gives rise to a qualitative change in the structure of a society. This mechanism, first recognized by Hegel, was seized on by Marx and Engels. However, neither they nor their current followers among anthropologists have made much use of it in attempting to explain social evolution. But as this paper attempts to show, in those few instances when the mechanism has been invoked, it has heightened our understanding of the process of social evolution. And, it is argued, if the mechanism were more widely applied, further understanding of the course of evolution could be expected to result.},

abstract = {The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "time-reversing" well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed.},

abstract = {Drug addiction is increasingly viewed as the endpoint of a series of transitions from initial drug use--when a drug is voluntarily taken because it has reinforcing, often hedonic, effects--through loss of control over this behavior, such that it becomes habitual and ultimately compulsive. Here we discuss evidence that these transitions depend on interactions between pavlovian and instrumental learning processes. We hypothesize that the change from voluntary drug use to more habitual and compulsive drug use represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior as well as a progression from ventral to more dorsal domains of the striatum, involving its dopaminergic innervation. These neural transitions may themselves depend on the neuroplasticity in both cortical and striatal structures that is induced by chronic self-administration of drugs.},

The development of devices that will allow healthcare providers to track treatment adherence and monitor physiological parameters with exact precision raises important questions and concerns. The aim of this study is to interrogate the use of these new technological devices which allow for previously unavailable data to be recorded on an ongoing basis and transmitted via a tiny microchip inserted into the body. Drawing on the work of Michel Foucault, we analyze how this anatomo-political and bio-political instrument serves to discipline chronically ill individuals and govern the health of entire populations who suffer from chronic conditions. To support our analysis, this article comprises three sections. First, we provide an overview of treatment adherence and technotherapeutics. Then, we explain how technotherapeutics concern the government of bodies and conducts at the individual level and population level more generally. Lastly, we provide an example of how this analysis can be connected to routine nursing practice in the field of HIV.},

abstract = {Fifty-eight pathological gamblers receiving treatment for addictive illness in two South Dakota hospitals were assessed for types of gambling and grouped into three categories; 15 "video lottery only" (VLO), 36 "video lottery mixed" (VLM), and 7 "not video lottery" (NVL). There were 51 male and 7 female respondents, with a mean age of 38.2. We hypothesized that video lottery would be the predominant type of gambling on several dimensions: level of recent activity, most money lost on one occasion, and number of DSM-IV criteria met. Of all gamblers, 87.9{\%} had pathological involvement with video lottery. Video lottery gambling accounted for the highest level of recent activity. In the VLM group, video lottery gambling led to greater single-occasion monetary losses. In addition, significantly more DSM-IV criteria were met in the VLM group for video lottery gambling than for other forms of gambling these subjects had engaged in. Results indicate that video lottery gambling is the predominant type of gambling behavior engaged in by gamblers seeking treatment for addictive illness in South Dakota.

abstract = {AIMS: This document provides health care professionals involved in initiating and monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy with guidelines for the provision of safe and effective patient self-testing/patient self-management of oral anticoagulation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The consensus group has critically reviewed the literature and compared the results of usual care (UC) vs. anticoagulation clinic and patient self-management/patient self-testing (PSM/PST). The education and training of patients for self-monitoring are described, together with the suitability of patients, the effect on quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The consensus agrees that patient self-testing and patient self-management are effective methods of monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy, providing outcomes at least as good as, and possibly better than, those achieved with an anticoagulation clinic. All patients must be appropriately selected and trained. Currently available self-testing/self-management devices give INR results which are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing. The most frequent testing frequency is weekly but lower frequency of testing can be justified based on institutional or patient conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: The consensus agrees that there are several points in favour of PST/PSM, for example, a higher degree of medical safety, increased patient education, improved response to changes in lifestyle, increased independence for the patient and improved quality of life.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The possible benefit of lifetime physical activity (PA) in reducing prostate cancer incidence and mortality is unclear. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 45,887 men aged 45-79 years was followed up from January 1998 to December 2007 for prostate cancer incidence (n=2735) and to December 2006 for its subtypes and for fatal (n=190) prostate cancer. RESULTS: We observed an inverse association between lifetime (average of age 30 and 50 years, and baseline age) total PA levels and prostate cancer risk. Multivariate-adjusted incidence in the top quartile of lifetime total PA decreased by 16{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=2-27{\%}) compared with that in the bottom quartile. We also observed an inverse association between average lifetime work or occupational activity and walking or bicycling duration and prostate cancer risk. Compared with men who mostly sit during their main work or occupation, men who sit half of the time experienced a 20{\%} lower risk (95{\%} CI=7-31{\%}). The rate ratio linearly decreased by 7{\%} (95{\%} CI=1-12{\%}) for total, 8{\%} (95{\%} CI=0-16{\%}) for localised and 12{\%} (95{\%} CI=2-20{\%}) for advanced prostate cancer for every 30 min per day increment of lifetime walking or bicycling in the range of 30 to 120 min per day. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that not sitting for most of the time during work or occupational activity and walking or bicycling more than 30 min per day during adult life is associated with reduced incidence of prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Purpose To describe physical activity (PA) intensity across a school day and assess the percentage of girls and boys achieving recommended guidelines. Methods The authors measured PA via accelerometry in 380 children (8-11 years) and examined data representing (1) the whole school day, (2) regular class time, (3) recess, (4) lunch and (5) scheduled physical education (PE). Activity was categorised as sedentary (SED), light physical activity (LPA) or moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using age-specific thresholds. They examined sex differences across PA intensities during each time period and compliance with recommended guidelines. Results Girls accumulated less MVPA and more SED than boys throughout the school day (MVPA -10.6 min; SED +13.9 min) recess (MVPA -1.6 min; SED +1.7 min) and lunch (MVPA -3.1 min; SED +2.9 min). Girls accumulated less MVPA (-6.2 min), less LPA (-2.5 min) and more SED (+9.4 min) than boys during regular class time. Fewer girls than boys achieved PA guidelines during school (90.9{\%} vs 96.2{\%}), recess (15.7{\%} vs 34.1{\%}) and lunch (16.7{\%} vs 37.4{\%}). During PE, only 1.8{\%} of girls and 2.9{\%} of boys achieved the PA guidelines. Girls and boys accumulated similar amounts of MVPA, LPA and SED. Conclusion The MVPA deficit in girls was due to their sedentary behaviour as opposed to LPA. Physical activity strategies that target girls are essential to overcome this deficit. Only a very small percentage of children met physical activity guidelines during PE. There is a great need for additional training and emphasis on PA during PE. In addition schools should complement PE with PA models that increase PA opportunities across the school day.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of physical activity patterns can be used to identify sedentary behaviour and may facilitate interventions aimed at reducing inactivity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activPAL physical activity monitor as a measure of posture and motion in everyday activities using observational analysis as the criterion standard. METHODS: Wearing three activPAL monitors, 10 healthy participants performed a range of randomly assigned everyday tasks incorporating walking, standing and sitting. Each trial was captured on a digital camera and the recordings were synchronised with the activPAL. The time spent in different postures was visually classified and this was compared with the activPAL output. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2,1) for interdevice reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.99. Using the Bland and Altman method, the mean percentage difference between the activPAL monitor and observation for total time spent sitting was 0.19{\%} (limits of agreement -0.68{\%} to 1.06{\%}) and for total time spent upright was -0.27{\%} (limits of agreement -1.38{\%} to 0.84{\%}). The mean difference for total time spent standing was 1.4{\%} (limits of agreement -6.2{\%} to 9.1{\%}) and for total time spent walking was -2.0{\%} (limits of agreement -16.1{\%} to 12.1{\%}). A second-by-second analysis between observer and monitor found an overall agreement of 95.9{\%}. CONCLUSION: The activPAL activity monitor is a valid and reliable measure of posture and motion during everyday physical activities.},

Humans expend energy through purposeful exercise and through changes in posture and movement that are associated with the routines of daily life [called nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)]. To examine NEAT's role in obesity, we recruited 10 lean and 10 mildly obese sedentary volunteers and measured their body postures and movements every half-second for 10 days. Obese individuals were seated, on average, 2 hours longer per day than lean individuals. Posture allocation did not change when the obese individuals lost weight or when lean individuals gained weight, suggesting that it is biologically determined. If obese individuals adopted the NEAT-enhanced behaviors of their lean counterparts, they might expend an additional 350 calories (kcal) per day.},

@article{Donahoo2004,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review factors contributing to variation in total daily energy expenditure and its primary components: (1) resting metabolic rate; (2) diet-induced thermogenesis; and (3) activity thermogenesis, including exercise energy expenditure and nonexercise activity. For each component, the expected magnitude of intra-individual variability is also considered. We also reviewed studies that quantified the variability in 24 h energy expenditure. RECENT FINDINGS: In humans, the coefficient of variation in the components of total daily energy expenditure is around 5-8{\%} for resting metabolic rate, 1-2{\%} for exercise energy expenditure, and around 20{\%} for diet-induced thermogenesis. The coefficient of variance for 24 h energy expenditure measured using a room calorimeter for resting metabolic rate is around 5-10{\%}. Thus, these measures are all rather reproducible. Total daily energy expenditure varies several-fold in humans, not due to variation in resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, or exercise thermogenesis, but rather, due to variations in nonexercise activity. A variety of factors impact nonexercise activity, including occupation, environment, education, genetics, age, gender, and body composition, but little is known about the magnitude of effect. SUMMARY: Resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, exercise energy expenditure, and 24 h energy expenditure are highly reproducible. Coefficient of variation is smallest for exercise energy expenditure, followed by resting metabolic rate, 24 h energy expenditure, and diet-induced thermogenesis. There is considerable variability in total daily energy expenditure, largely due to variations in nonexercise activity. Although the factors that impact upon nonexercise activity are understood, their contribution to variation in total daily energy expenditure is unclear.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and metabolic syndrome in a representative sample of U.S. adults. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A total of 1626 men and women > or =20 years old from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2000 who attended the morning examination were evaluated. The metabolic syndrome was defined by using the definition from the National Cholesterol Education Program. RESULTS: In unadjusted analysis, participants who did not engage in any moderate or vigorous physical activity during leisure time had almost twice the odds of having metabolic syndrome [odds ratio (OR), 1.90; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.22 to 2.97] as those who reportedly engaged in > or =150 min/wk of such activity. Adjustment for age, sex, race or ethnicity, educational status, smoking status, and alcohol use attenuated the OR (OR, 1.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 2.45). Compared with participants who watched television or videos or used a computer <1 h/d outside of work, the adjusted ORs for having metabolic syndrome were 1.41 (95{\%} CI 0.80 to 2.51) for 1 h/d, 1.37 (95{\%} CI 0.85 to 2.20) for 2 h/d, 1.70 (95{\%} CI 0.92 to 3.14) for 3 h/d, and 2.10 (95{\%} CI 1.27 to 3.47) for > or =4 h/d. Additional adjustment for physical activity or sedentary behavior minimally affected the ORs. DISCUSSION: Sedentary behavior is an important potential determinant of the prevalence of the syndrome. Efforts to lessen the amount of time that U.S. adults spend watching television or videos or using a computer, especially if coupled to increases in physical activity, could result in substantial decreases in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.},

@article{Hawkins2009,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Accelerometers were incorporated in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) study cycle for objective assessment of physical activity. This is the first time that objective physical activity data are available on a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. The use of accelerometers allows researchers to measure total physical activity, including light intensity and unstructured activities, which may be a better predictor of health outcomes than structured activity alone. The aim of this study was to examine objectively determined physical activity levels by sex, age and racial/ethnic groups in a national sample of U.S. adults. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2003-2004 NHANES, a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability sample of the U.S. population. Physical activity was assessed with the Actigraph AM-7164 accelerometer for seven days following an examination. 2,688 U.S. adults with valid accelerometer data (i.e. at least four days with at least 10 hours of wear-time) were included in the analysis. Mean daily total physical activity counts, as well as counts accumulated in minutes of light, and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity are presented by sex across age and racial/ethnic groups. Generalized linear modeling using the log link function was performed to compare physical activity in sex and racial/ethnic groups adjusting for age. RESULTS: Physical activity decreases with age for both men and women across all racial/ethnic groups with men being more active than women, with the exception of Hispanic women. Hispanic women are more active at middle age (40-59 years) compared to younger or older age and not significantly less active than men in middle or older age groups (i.e. age 40-59 or age 60 and older). Hispanic men accumulate more total and light intensity physical activity counts than their white and black counterparts for all age groups. CONCLUSION: Physical activity levels measured objectively by accelerometer demonstrated that Hispanic men are, in general, more active than their white and black counterparts. This appears to be in contrast to self-reported physical activity previously reported in the literature and identifies the need to use objective measures in situations where the contribution of light intensity and/or unstructured physical activity cannot be assumed homogenous across the populations of interest.},

abstract = {Activity-related energy expenditure (AEE) is difficult to quantify, especially under sedentary conditions. Here, a model was developed using the detected type of physical activity (PA) and movement intensity (MI), based on a tri-axial seismic accelerometer (DynaPort MiniMod; McRoberts B.V., The Hague, the Netherlands), with energy expenditure for PA as a reference. The relation between AEE (J/min/kg), MI, and the type of PA was determined for standardized PAs as performed in a laboratory including: lying, sitting, standing, and walking. AEE (J/min/kg) was calculated from total energy expenditure (TEE) and sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) as assessed with indirect calorimetry ((TEEx0.9)-SMR). Subsequently, the model was validated over 23-h intervals in a respiration chamber. Subjects were 15 healthy women (age: 22+/-2 years; BMI: 24.0+/-4.0 kg/m2). Predicted AEE in the chamber was significantly related to measured AEE both within (r2=0.81+/-0.06, P<0.00001) and between (r2=0.70, P<0.001) subjects. The explained variation in AEE by the model was higher than the explained variation by MI alone. This shows that a tri-axial seismic accelerometer is a valid tool for estimating AEE under sedentary conditions.},

@article{Chaput2009,
abstract = {The population statistics of most countries of the world are indicating that industrialization and computerization have been associated with an increase in sedentariness and more recently with a significant shift from healthy weight to overweight. In general, this change in the overweight/obesity prevalence is attributed by health professionals to suboptimal diet and physical activity practices. However, recent data raised the possibility that excess weight gain might also be the outcome of changes imposed by our '24-hour', hectic lifestyle. Parallel to an increase in body weight, one has observed a reduction in sleep time and an increase in knowledge-based work (KBW) that appear as a growing necessity in a context of economic competitiveness and globalization. Sleep and cognitive work both exert a trivial effect on energy expenditure and may thus be considered as sedentary activities. However, their respective effect on energy intake is opposite. Indeed, an increase in the practice of the most sedentary activity, i.e. sleep, is associated with a hormonal profile facilitating appetite control whereas KBW appears as a stimulus favoring a significant enhancing effect on food intake. Television viewing is another example of sedentary activity that has been shown to increase the intake of high-density foods. These observations demonstrate that the modern way of living has favored a change in human activities whose impact goes well beyond what has traditionally been attributed to a lack of physical exercise. Therefore, we will need to reconsider the notion of 'sedentariness' which includes several activities having opposing effects on energy balance.},

abstract = {Sedentary time (too much sitting) increasingly is being recognized as a distinct health risk behavior. This paper reviews the reliability and validity of self-reported and device-based sedentary time measures and provides recommendations for their use in population-based studies. The focus is on instruments that have been used in free-living, population-based research in adults. Data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey are utilized to compare the descriptive epidemiology of sedentary time that arises from the use of different sedentary time measures. A key recommendation from this review is that, wherever possible, population-based monitoring of sedentary time should incorporate both self-reported measures (to capture important domain- and behavior-specific sedentary time information) and device-based measures (to measure both total sedentary time and patterns of sedentary time accumulation).},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between physical activity and mortality in a 7-year follow-up of a sample of women more than 30 years of age (N = 6,620) from the Canada Fitness Survey cohort, which was initiated in 1981. Age-adjusted relative risks relating quartiles of average daily energy expenditure (kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per day) to mortality were estimated using logistic regression. Compared with the least active, the risk of all-cause mortality was 0.73 for those in the highest quartile (P for trend = 0.03). The associations were stronger for cardiovascular disease mortality (odds ratio = 0.51; P for trend = 0.01) and fatal myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 0.61; P for trend = 0.04) for those in the highest quartile. These relations were due mainly to the contribution of non-leisure (household chores) energy expenditure, which represented, on average, 82{\%} of women's total activity. The accompanying study on the same cohort by Villeneuve et al reported estimates based on a subset of leisure-time physical activity only, which underestimates the activity of many women (Villeneuve PJ, Morrison HI, Craig CL, Schaubel DE. Physical activity, physical fitness, and risk of dying. Epidemiology 1998;9;632-635). The resulting bias illustrates the importance of including non-leisure energy expenditure in the assessment of total activity. These data support the hypothesis that physical activity is inversely associated with risk of death in women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence on the correlates of objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in childhood is limited. This study aimed to identify correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviour among 7-year-old children in England. METHODS: Physical activity was measured using Actigraph accelerometry in 480 participants as part of the Gateshead Millennium Study during 2006-07. Twenty-two potential correlates across five domains (demographic and biological; psychological, cognitive and emotional; behavioural; social and cultural; physical environmental) were tested for associations with total volume of habitual physical activity, moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behaviour. Multiple linear regression analysis was used. RESULTS: Seven correlates, including four that are potentially modifiable, were significantly associated with total physical activity, MVPA and sedentary behaviour in final models: gender, child weight status, maternal age, child interest in active play, active commuting to school, parenting practice and season. Four of these variables were significantly associated with all three constructs in final models. The final models explained 18, 18 and 24{\%} of variance in total volume of physical activity, MVPA and sedentary behaviour, respectively. CONCLUSION: A number of potentially modifiable factors are associated with increased physical activity and/or reduced sedentary behaviour in English children. These could be valuable targets of future interventions.},

@article{Bonomi2009a,
abstract = {Accelerometers are often used to quantify the acceleration of the body in arbitrary units (counts) to measure physical activity (PA) and to estimate energy expenditure. The present study investigated whether the identification of types of PA with one accelerometer could improve the estimation of energy expenditure compared with activity counts. Total energy expenditure (TEE) of 15 subjects was measured with the use of double-labeled water. The physical activity level (PAL) was derived by dividing TEE by sleeping metabolic rate. Simultaneously, PA was measured with one accelerometer. Accelerometer output was processed to calculate activity counts per day (AC(D)) and to determine the daily duration of six types of common activities identified with a classification tree model. A daily metabolic value (MET(D)) was calculated as mean of the MET compendium value of each activity type weighed by the daily duration. TEE was predicted by AC(D) and body weight and by AC(D) and fat-free mass, with a standard error of estimate (SEE) of 1.47 MJ/day, and 1.2 MJ/day, respectively. The replacement in these models of AC(D) with MET(D) increased the explained variation in TEE by 9{\%}, decreasing SEE by 0.14 MJ/day and 0.18 MJ/day, respectively. The correlation between PAL and MET(D) (R(2) = 51{\%}) was higher than that between PAL and AC(D) (R(2) = 46{\%}). We conclude that identification of activity types combined with MET intensity values improves the assessment of energy expenditure compared with activity counts. Future studies could develop models to objectively assess activity type and intensity to further increase accuracy of the energy expenditure estimation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative accuracy during treadmill walking and motor vehicle travel of the ActivPAL(TM), PALlite(TM) and Digi-Walker(TM) accelerometers. METHODS: Forty healthy volunteers wearing all accelerometers undertook either five treadmill walks (n=20) at speeds ranging between 0.6-1.4m/s or a 15min motor vehicle journey (n=20). Step counts recorded by each accelerometer were compared to the actual step count determined by video analysis (treadmill walking) or to an actual step count of zero (motor vehicle). Mean percentage measurement error was calculated and compared between devices by one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test. RESULTS: For treadmill walking, the measurement error was lowest for the ActivPAL, with no significant differences between the ActivPAL and the PALlite monitors. The measurement error was significantly higher for the Digi-Walker at speeds of </=1m/s. During vehicle travel erroneous steps were recorded by the PALlite (254 steps) and Digi-Walker (25 steps), but not the AcitvPAL monitor (0 steps). CONCLUSIONS: The ActivPAL accelerometer accurately measures step count over a range of walking speeds and, unlike the other accelerometers tested, is not falsely triggered by motor vehicle travel.},

METHODS: Participants (N = 289, 44.6{\%} male, mean age = 35.93) from 3 countries completed self-administered long- and short-IPAQ sitting items. Participants wore accelerometers; were classified as inactive (no leisure-time activity), insufficiently active, or meeting recommendations; and were classified into tertiles of sitting behavior. RESULTS: Reliability of sitting time was acceptable for men and women. Correlations between total sitting and accelerometer counts/min <100 were significant for both long (r = .33) and short (r = .34) forms. There was no agreement between tertiles of sitting and the inactivity category (kappa = .02, P = .68). CONCLUSION: Sedentary behavior should be explicitly measured in population surveillance and research instead of being defined by lack of physical activity.},

Workers (N = 185) wore a pedometer for 7 days and recorded the number of steps taken and time spent sitting each day. Average time spent sitting on weekdays was 9.4 (SD = 2.40) hr, with about half spent sitting at work. Despite this, the average steps taken each day (M = 8,873, SD = 2,757) was higher on weekdays than on weekend days. There was a clear inverse relationship between sitting time at work and number of steps taken on weekdays, r = -.34, p < .001); those in the highest tertile for sitting time reported about 3,000 fewer daily steps. Workers in managerial and professional occupations reported more time sitting at work (M = 6.2 hr per day) and lower weekday step counts (M = 7,883, N = 43) than technical (M = 3.3 hr sitting at work and 10,731 weekday steps, N = 33) and blue collar workers (M = 1.6 hours sitting and 11,784 steps, N = 11). The findings suggest those whose daily work involves long hours of sitting should be the focus of efforts to promote physical activity both within and outside the workplace.},

By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93{\%} potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of a variety of Actical accelerometer count thresholds for determining sitting time in a sample of office workers. METHODS: Data were collected from 21 participants in Auckland, New Zealand, between December 2009 and January 2010. Participants wore a hip-mounted Actical accelerometer and thigh-mounted activPAL inclinometer (criterion) for a 48-h period. Raw inclinometer and accelerometer data for each 15s epoch of wear time were matched by date and time. Candidate accelerometer count thresholds for sitting classification were compared with the criterion measure using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Agreement in sitting time classification was determined using Bland-Altman methodology. RESULTS: Significant differences in area under the curve (AUC) values by threshold criteria were found (p<0.001). A threshold of 0 counts provided the highest combined sensitivity and specificity (AUC 0.759, 95{\%}CI 0.756, 0.761). The 95{\%} limits of agreement for time spent sitting were wide, at 328min (range -30.8, 297.5). CONCLUSION: A threshold of 0 counts/15s epoch with Actical accelerometers is likely to yield the most accurate quantification of sitting in office-based workers, however the wide limits of agreement found indicate limited utility of this threshold to accurately distinguish sitting time in office-based workers.},

abstract = {Obesity is a major health challenge facing the modern world. Some evidence points to obesity itself as the main driver of premature mortality. We propose that this view is oversimplified. For example, high levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with lower mortality, even in those who are overweight or obese. To address this issue, we combine epidemiological and physiological evidence in a new paradigm that integrates excess calorie intake, sedentary behavior, and a maladaptive response to stress. Human physiology is optimized to allow large distances to be covered on foot every day in order to find enough food to sustain brain metabolism. Furthermore, when the body is immobilized by an injury, it triggers efficient life-saving metabolic and inflammatory responses. Both these critical adaptations are, however, confounded by a sedentary lifestyle. The implications of these issues for clinical trial design and epidemiologic data analysis are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The Australian Women's Activity Survey (AWAS) was developed based on a systematic review and qualitative research on how to measure activity patterns of women with young children (WYC). AWAS assesses activity performed across five domains (planned activities, employment, child care, domestic responsibilities, and transport) and intensity levels (sitting, light intensity, brisk walking, moderate intensity, and vigorous intensity) in a typical week in the past month. The purpose of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and criterion validity of the AWAS. METHODS: WYC completed the AWAS on two occasions 7 d apart (test-retest reliability protocol) and/or wore a Manufacturing Technology Inc. (MTI) ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 d in between (validity protocol). Forty WYC (mean age 35 +/- 5 yr) completed the test-retest reliability protocol and 75 WYC (mean age 33 +/- 5 yr) completed the validity protocol. Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between AWAS administrations and Spearman's correlation coefficients (rs) between AWAS and MTI data were calculated. RESULTS: AWAS showed good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.80 (0.65-0.89)) and acceptable criterion validity (rs = 0.28, P = 0.01) for measuring weekly health-enhancing physical activity. AWAS also provided repeatable and valid estimates of sitting time (test-retest reliability, ICC = 0.42 (0.13-0.64); criterion validity, rs = 0.32, (P = 0.006)). CONCLUSION: The measurement properties of the AWAS are comparable to those reported for existing self-report measures of physical activity. However, AWAS offers a more comprehensive and flexible alternative for accurately assessing different domains and intensities of activity relevant to WYC. Future research should investigate whether the AWAS is a suitable measure of intervention efficacy by examining its sensitivity to change.},

All subjects continued their usual work and leisure-time activities whilst we measured daily activity and body postures for 10 days.

Similarly, work days were associated with less standing (341 +/- 97 min/day; P = 0.002) than leisure days (417 +/- 101 min/day). Although the walking bouts did not differ significantly between work and leisure (46 +/- 9 vs. 42 +/- 9 walking bouts/day); the mean free-living velocity of a walk at work was 1.08 +/- 0.28 mph and on leisure days was 0.94 +/- 0.24 mph (P = 0.03) and the average time spent walking was 322 +/- 91 min on work days and 380 +/- 108 min on leisure days (P = 0.03). Estimates of the daily energetic cost of walking approximated 527 +/- 220 kcal/day for work days and 586 +/- 326 kcal/day for leisure days (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). Work days are associated with more sitting and less walking/standing time than leisure days. We suggest a need to develop approaches to free people from their chairs and render them more active.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Current public health campaigns to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes have largely focused on increasing exercise, but have paid little attention to the reduction of sedentary behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between various sedentary behaviors, especially prolonged television (TV) watching, and risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study conducted from 1992 to 1998 among women from 11 states in the Nurses' Health Study. The obesity analysis included 50 277 women who had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 and were free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer and completed questions on physical activity and sedentary behaviors at baseline. The diabetes analysis included 68 497 women who at baseline were free from diagnosed diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: During 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5{\%}) of 50 277 women who had a BMI of less than 30 in 1992 became obese (BMI > or =30). Overall, we documented 1515 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Time spent watching TV was positively associated with risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the multivariate analyses adjusting for age, smoking, exercise levels, dietary factors, and other covariates, each 2-h/d increment in TV watching was associated with a 23{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 17{\%}-30{\%}) increase in obesity and a 14{\%} (95{\%} CI, 5{\%}-23{\%}) increase in risk of diabetes; each 2-h/d increment in sitting at work was associated with a 5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-10{\%}) increase in obesity and a 7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-16{\%}) increase in diabetes. In contrast, standing or walking around at home (2 h/d) was associated with a 9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 6{\%}-12{\%}) reduction in obesity and a 12{\%} (95{\%} CI, 7{\%}-16{\%}) reduction in diabetes. Each 1 hour per day of brisk walking was associated with a 24{\%} (95{\%} CI, 19{\%}-29{\%}) reduction in obesity and a 34{\%} (95{\%} CI, 27{\%}-41{\%}) reduction in diabetes. We estimated that in our cohort, 30{\%} (95{\%} CI, 24{\%}-36{\%}) of new cases of obesity and 43{\%} (95{\%} CI, 32{\%}-52{\%}) of new cases of diabetes could be prevented by adopting a relatively active lifestyle (<10 h/wk of TV watching and > or =30 min/d of brisk walking). CONCLUSIONS: Independent of exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk. This study emphasizes the importance of reducing prolonged TV watching and other sedentary behaviors for preventing obesity and diabetes.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the ability of alternative measures of physical activity and fitness to quantify associations with health outcomes. METHODS: Associations between a range of subjective and objective physical activity and fitness measures and cardiometabolic risk factors were examined using data from 1,631 Australians aged 26-36 years. Anthropometry, fitness, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipids were measured at study clinics. Participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day pedometer diaries; they also reported sedentary behavior (sitting, television viewing). RESULTS: In men and women, associations were strongest for fitness, with those in the highest (vs. lowest) fitness quarter having a 75{\%} to 80{\%} lower prevalence of two or more primary risk factors (waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin resistance). In men, a 60{\%} to 70{\%} reduced prevalence of two or more risk factors was observed across extreme quarters of IPAQ leisure, IPAQ vigorous, sitting duration, and pedometer measures. Similar reductions in prevalence were observed only across extreme quarters of pedometer activity and television viewing in women. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between alternative measures and cardiometabolic risk were relatively independent, suggesting that a range of physical activity and fitness measures may be needed to most accurately quantify associations between physical activity and health.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between objective measures of sedentary behavior and cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in adolescents. A secondary aim was to evaluate the degree of association between overall and abdominal adiposity and CRFs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 210 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Measurements were made of the sum of the skinfold thicknesses at six locations (sum6), waist circumference (WC), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoproteins A-1 and B-100. A CRF score was calculated from the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and TG, HDL-C and glucose levels. Sedentary behavior was assessed over 7 days using an accelerometer. Participants were divided into tertiles according to sedentary behavior and into low and high levels of overall (sum6) and abdominal (WC) adiposity. RESULTS: Adolescents with a high level of sedentary behavior had less favorable SBP, TG and glucose levels and CRF scores. Adolescents with a high level of overall adiposity demonstrated significant differences in five of the 11 variables analyzed (i.e. DBP, LDL-C, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score), while adolescents with a high level of abdominal adiposity had differences in eight (i.e. SBP, MAP, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score). Adolescents with high levels of both overall and abdominal adiposity and sedentary behavior had the least favorable CRF scores. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behavior was associated with CRFs in adolescents, especially in obese adolescents. Abdominal adiposity seemed to play a more significant role in the development of CRFs than overall adiposity.},

abstract = {Factors that influence circulating sex hormones, such as physical activity, have been proposed to influence ovarian cancer risk; however, results from previous epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent. The authors examined the association among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and ovarian cancer risk in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective study of cancer incidence and mortality, using information obtained at baseline in 1992. From 1992 to 2001, 314 incident ovarian cancer cases were identified among 59,695 postmenopausal women who were cancer free at enrollment. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compute hazard rate ratios while adjusting for potential confounders. No overall association was observed between measures of past physical activity or with recreational physical activity at baseline and risk of ovarian cancer in this study (for the highest category of physical activity compared with none: hazard rate ratio = 0.73, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.40, 1.34). However, a prolonged duration of sedentary behavior was associated with an increased risk (for > or = 6 vs. < 3 hours per day: hazard rate ratio = 1.55, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.08, 2.22; p(trend) = 0.01). Results from this study suggest that high levels of sedentary behavior may increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but they do not support a major impact of light and moderate physical activity on ovarian cancer risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effectiveness of workplace interventions for reducing sitting. METHODS: Studies published up to April 2009 were identified by literature searches in multiple databases. Studies were included if they were interventions to increase energy expenditure (increase physical activity or decrease sitting); were conducted in a workplace setting; and specifically measured sitting as a primary or secondary outcome. Two independent reviewers assessed methodological quality of the included studies, and data on study design, sample, measures of sitting, intervention and results were extracted. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria (five randomised trials and one pre-post study). The primary aim of all six was to increase physical activity; all had reducing sitting as a secondary aim. All used self-report measures of sitting; one specifically assessed occupational sitting time; the others used measures of general sitting. No studies showed that sitting decreased significantly in the intervention group, compared with a control or comparison group. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is a dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of workplace interventions for reducing sitting. In light of the growing body of evidence that prolonged sitting is negatively associated with health, this highlights a gap in the scientific literature that needs to be addressed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) is widely used to assess risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Cut points for the classification of obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) have been developed and validated among people of European descent. It is unknown whether these cut points are appropriate for non-European populations. We assessed the metabolic risk associated with BMI among South Asians, Chinese, Aboriginals, and Europeans. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly sampled 1078 subjects from 4 ethnic groups (289 South Asians, 281 Chinese, 207 Aboriginals, and 301 Europeans) from 4 regions in Canada. Principal components factor analysis was used to derive underlying latent or "hidden" factors associated with 14 clinical and biochemical cardiometabolic markers. Ethnic-specific BMI cut points were derived for 3 cardiometabolic factors. Three primary latent factors emerged that accounted for 56{\%} of the variation in markers of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and blood pressure. For a given BMI, elevated levels of glucose- and lipid-related factors were more likely to be present in South Asians, Chinese, and Aboriginals compared with Europeans, and elevated levels of the blood pressure-related factor were more likely to be present among Chinese compared with Europeans. The cut point to define obesity, as defined by distribution of glucose and lipid factors, is lower by approximately 6 kg/m2 among non-European groups compared with Europeans. CONCLUSIONS: Revisions may be warranted for BMI cut points to define obesity among South Asians, Chinese, and Aboriginals. Using these revised cut points would greatly increase the estimated burden of obesity-related metabolic disorders among non-European populations.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: This paper 1) provides the calibration procedures and methods for metabolic and activity monitor data collection, 2) compares measured MET values to the MET values from the Compendium of Physical Activities, and 3) examines the relationship between accelerometer output and METs for a range of physical activities METHODS:: Participants (n=277) completed 11 activities for seven minutes each from a menu of 23 physical activities. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured using a portable metabolic system and an accelerometer was worn. MET values were defined as follows; measuredMETs (VO2/measured RMR) and standardMETs (VO2/3.5ml.kg.min). For the total sample and by sub-group (age [young <40y], sex and BMI [normal-weight <25 kg.m]), measuredMETs and standardMETs were compared to the Compendium, using 95{\%} confidence intervals to determine statistical significance (alpha=0.05). Average count.min for each activity and the linear association between count.min and METs are presented. RESULTS:: Compendium METs were different than measured METs for 17/21 activities (81{\%}). The number of activities different than the Compendium were similar between sub-groups or when standard METs were used. The average counts for the activities ranged from 11 counts.min(dishes) to 7490 counts.min (2.23m.s, 3{\%}) The r between counts and METs was 0.65. CONCLUSIONS:: This study provides valuable information about data collection, metabolic responses, and accelerometer output for common physical activities in a diverse participant sample. The Compendium should be updated with additional empirical data and linear regression models are inappropriate for accurately predicting METs from accelerometer output.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing levels of physical inactivity and sedentariness are contributing to the current overweight and obesity epidemic. In this paper, the findings of two recent studies are used to explore the relationships between sitting time (in transport, work and leisure), physical activity and body mass index (BMI) in two contrasting samples of adult Australians. METHODS: Data on sitting time, physical activity, BMI and a number of demographic characteristics were compared for participants in two studies-529 women who were participants in a preschool health promotion project ('mothers'), and 185 men and women who were involved in a workplace pedometer study ('workers'). Relationships between age, number of children, physical activity, sitting time, BMI, gender and work patterns were explored. Logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of being overweight or obese, among participants with different physical activity, sitting time and work patterns. RESULTS: The total reported time spent sitting per day (across all domains) was almost 6 h less among the mothers than the workers (P<0.001), and compared with the mothers, a significantly greater proportion of the workers was classified as overweight or obese (BMI > or =25 kg/m(2)). Univariate analysis found that, compared with men in full-time work, women who worked full-time (OR=0.42, CI: 0.24-0.74), part-time (OR=0.35, CI: 0.20-0.59) or in full-time home duties (OR=0.51, CI: 0.29-0.88) were about half as likely to be overweight or obese. Participants who reported high daily levels of sitting (> or =7.4 h) were also significantly more likely than those who reported 'low' levels (<4.7 h/day) to be overweight or obese (OR=1.68, CI: 1.16-2.42). Multivariate analysis (including physical activity, work patterns and sitting time) confirmed that full-time and part-time working women (but not 'home duties' women) were less likely to report BMI > or =25 kg/m(2) than full-time working men (full-time: OR=0.44, CI: 0.25-0.78; part-time: OR=0.45, CI: 0.24-0.86), but the OR for BMI > or =25 among those in the high sitting category was attenuated (OR=1.61, CI 0.96-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a need for inclusion of measures of both activity and inactivity in future studies, so that the complex relationships between these behavioural determinants of BMI can be clarified.},

abstract = {Research is now required on factors influencing adults' sedentary behaviors, and effective approaches to behavioral-change intervention must be identified. The strategies for influencing sedentary behavior will need to be informed by evidence on the most important modifiable behavioral determinants. However, much of the available evidence relevant to understanding the determinants of sedentary behaviors is from cross-sectional studies, which are limited in that they identify only behavioral "correlates." As is the case for physical activity, a behavior- and context-specific approach is needed to understand the multiple determinants operating in the different settings within which these behaviors are most prevalent. To this end, an ecologic model of sedentary behaviors is described, highlighting the behavior settings construct. The behaviors and contexts of primary concern are TV viewing and other screen-focused behaviors in domestic environments, prolonged sitting in the workplace, and time spent sitting in automobiles. Research is needed to clarify the multiple levels of determinants of prolonged sitting time, which are likely to operate in distinct ways in these different contexts. Controlled trials on the feasibility and efficacy of interventions to reduce and break up sedentary behaviors among adults in domestic, workplace, and transportation environments are particularly required. It would be informative for the field to have evidence on the outcomes of "natural experiments," such as the introduction of nonseated working options in occupational environments or new transportation infrastructure in communities.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined parent-child attitudes on value of specific types and intensities of physical activity, which may explain gender differences in child activity, and evaluated physical activity as a mechanism to reduce time spent in sedentary behaviors. DESIGN: A community sample of 681 parents and 433 children (mean age 9.9 years) reported attitudes on importance of vigorous and moderate intensity team and individually performed sports/activities, as well as household chores. Separate structural models (LISREL 8.7) for girls and boys tested whether parental attitudes were related to child TV and computer via child attitudes, sport team participation, and physical activity, controlling for demographic factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Child 7-day physical activity, sport teams, weekly TV, computer. RESULTS: Parent-child attitude congruence was more prevalent among boys, and attitudes varied by ethnicity, parent education, and number of children. Positive parent-child attitudes for vigorous team sports were related to increased team participation and physical activity, as well as reduced TV and computer in boys and girls. Value of moderate intensity household chores, such as cleaning house and doing laundry, was related to decreased team participation and increased TV in boys. Only organized team sports, not general physical activity, was related to reduced TV and computer. CONCLUSION: Results support parents' role in socializing children's achievement task values, affecting child activity by transferring specific attitudes. Value of vigorous intensity sports provided the most benefits to activity and reduction of sedentary behavior, while valuing household chores had unexpected negative effects.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) the inter-relationships between socio-economic status (SES), physical activity, three different domains of sitting time (weekday, weekend day and leisure-time sitting), and being overweight or obese (body mass index>/=25 kg/m(2)); and (2) the potential mediation effects of sitting time in the relationship between socio-economic factors and being overweight or obese in working Australian adults. DESIGN: Observational epidemiological study. SUBJECTS: One thousand forty eight working adults. Using a multistage sampling design on neighbourhood SES, participants were from high and low SES neighbourhoods of an Australian capital city. MEASUREMENTS: Neighbourhood SES was assessed using census data; individual SES was based on self-reported educational attainment and household income. There were three sitting time variables: sitting time on weekdays, weekend days and in leisure time. Overweight and obesity were determined using self-reported body weight and height. RESULTS: Gender, age, neighbourhood SES, education, working hours and physical activity were independently associated with weekday, weekend day and leisure-related sitting time. With the exception of education and working hours, these variables were also independently associated with being overweight or obese. Leisure-time sitting was found to be a mediator in the relationships between gender, education and being overweight or obese. CONCLUSION: Strategies to promote less sitting in leisure time are required to combat overweight and obesity in Australian adults, especially among those from low SES neighbourhoods, and among those with high levels of education and income who work long hours.},

Among 6,329 participants with at least one 10-hour day of monitor wear, the average monitor-wearing time was 13.9 hours/day (standard deviation, 1.9). Overall, participants spent 54.9{\%} of their monitored time, or 7.7 hours/day, in sedentary behaviors. The most sedentary groups in the United States were older adolescents and adults aged >/=60 years, and they spent about 60{\%} of their waking time in sedentary pursuits. Females were more sedentary than males before age 30 years, but this pattern was reversed after age 60 years. Mexican-American adults were significantly less sedentary than other US adults, and White and Black females were similarly sedentary after age 12 years. These data provide the first objective measure of the amount of time spent in sedentary behavior in the US population and indicate that Americans spend the majority of their time in behaviors that expend very little energy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to compare the concurrent accuracy of the CSA accelerometer and the Yamax pedometer under two conditions: 1) on a treadmill at five different speeds and 2) riding in a motorized vehicle on paved roads. METHODS: In study 1, motion sensor performance was evaluated against actual steps taken during 5-min bouts at five different treadmill walking speeds (54, 67, 80, 94, and 107 m.min-1). In study 2, performance was evaluated during a roundtrip (drive 1 and drive 2) motor vehicle travel on paved roads (total distance traveled was 32.6 km or 20.4 miles). Any steps detected during motor vehicle travel were considered error. RESULTS: In study 1, the Yamax pedometer detected significantly (P < 0.05) fewer steps than actually taken at the slowest treadmill speed (54 m.min-1). Further, the pedometer detected fewer steps than the accelerometer at this speed (75.4{\%} vs 98.9{\%}, P < 0.05). There were no differences between instruments compared with actual steps taken at all other walking speeds. In study 2, the CSA detected approximately 17-fold more erroneous steps than the pedometer (approximately 250 vs 15 steps for the total distance traveled, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the error (for either instrument) is not likely an important threat to the assessment of free-living ambulatory populations but may be a problem for pedometers when monitoring frail older adults with slow gaits. On the other hand, CSA accelerometers erroneously detect more nonsteps than the Yamax pedometer under typical motor vehicle traveling conditions. This threat to validity is likely only problematic when using the accelerometer to assess physical activity in sedentary individuals who travel extensively by motor vehicle.},

@article{Katzmarzyk2009,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Although moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is related to premature mortality, the relationship between sedentary behaviors and mortality has not been fully explored and may represent a different paradigm than that associated with lack of exercise. We prospectively examined sitting time and mortality in a representative sample of 17,013 Canadians 18-90 yr of age. METHODS: Evaluation of daily sitting time (almost none of the time, one fourth of the time, half of the time, three fourths of the time, almost all of the time), leisure time physical activity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption was conducted at baseline. Participants were followed prospectively for an average of 12.0 yr for the ascertainment of mortality status. RESULTS: There were 1832 deaths (759 of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 547 of cancer) during 204,732 person-yr of follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was a progressively higher risk of mortality across higher levels of sitting time from all causes (hazard ratios (HR): 1.00, 1.00, 1.11, 1.36, 1.54; P for trend <0.0001) and CVD (HR:1.00, 1.01, 1.22, 1.47, 1.54; P for trend <0.0001) but not cancer. Similar results were obtained when stratified by sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index. Age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates per 10,000 person-yr of follow-up were 87, 86, 105, 130, and 161 (P for trend <0.0001) in physically inactive participants and 75, 69, 76, 98, 105 (P for trend = 0.008) in active participants across sitting time categories. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a dose-response association between sitting time and mortality from all causes and CVD, independent of leisure time physical activity. In addition to the promotion of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and a healthy weight, physicians should discourage sitting for extended periods.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, colon cancer, breast cancer, dementia and depression constitute a cluster of diseases, which defines 'a diseasome of physical inactivity'. Both physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity, reflecting accumulation of visceral fat mass, are associated with the occurrence of the diseases within the diseasome. Physical inactivity appears to be an independent and strong risk factor for accumulation of visceral fat, which again is a source of systemic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and tumour growth. Evidence suggests that the protective effect of exercise may to some extent be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory effect of regular exercise, which can be mediated via a reduction in visceral fat mass and/or by induction of an anti-inflammatory environment with each bout of exercise. The finding that muscles produce and release myokines provides a conceptual basis to understand the mechanisms whereby exercise influences metabolism and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. According to our theory, contracting skeletal muscles release myokines, which work in a hormone-like fashion, exerting specific endocrine effects on visceral fat. Other myokines work locally within the muscle via paracrine mechanisms, exerting their effects on signalling pathways involved in fat oxidation.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:: The use of movement monitors (accelerometers) for measuring physical activity (PA) in intervention and population-based studies is becoming a standard methodology for the objective measurement of sedentary and active behaviors and for validation of subjective PA self-reports. A vital step in PA measurements is classification of daily time into accelerometer wear and nonwear intervals using its recordings (counts) and an accelerometer-specific algorithm. PURPOSE:: To validate and improve a commonly used algorithm for classifying accelerometer wear and nonwear time intervals using objective movement data obtained in the whole-room indirect calorimeter. METHODS:: We conducted a validation study of a wear/nonwear automatic algorithm using data obtained from 49 adults and 76 youth wearing accelerometers during a strictly monitored 24-h stay in a room calorimeter. The accelerometer wear and nonwear time classified by the algorithm was compared with actual wearing time. Potential improvements to the algorithm were examined using the minimum classification error as an optimization target. RESULTS:: The recommended elements in the new algorithm are: 1) zero-count threshold during a nonwear time interval, 2) 90-min time window for consecutive zero/nonzero counts, and 3) allowance of 2-min interval of nonzero counts with the up/downstream 30-min consecutive zero counts window for detection of artifactual movements. Compared to the true wearing status, improvements to the algorithm decreased nonwear time misclassification during the waking and the 24-h periods (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:: The accelerometer wear/nonwear time algorithm improvements may lead to more accurate estimation of time spent in sedentary and active behaviors.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Interventions designed to increase workplace physical activity may not automatically reduce high volumes of sitting, a behaviour independently linked to chronic diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes. This study compared the impact two different walking strategies had on step counts and reported sitting times. METHODS: Participants were white-collar university employees (n = 179; age 41.3 +/- 10.1 years; 141 women), who volunteered and undertook a standardised ten-week intervention at three sites. Pre-intervention step counts (Yamax SW-200) and self-reported sitting times were measured over five consecutive workdays. Using pre-intervention step counts, employees at each site were randomly allocated to a control group (n = 60; maintain normal behaviour), a route-based walking group (n = 60; at least 10 minutes sustained walking each workday) or an incidental walking group (n = 59; walking in workday tasks). Workday step counts and reported sitting times were re-assessed at the beginning, mid- and endpoint of intervention and group mean+/- SD steps/day and reported sitting times for pre-intervention and intervention measurement points compared using a mixed factorial ANOVA; paired sample-t-tests were used for follow-up, simple effect analyses. RESULTS: A significant interactive effect (F = 3.5; p < 0.003) was found between group and step counts. Daily steps for controls decreased over the intervention period (-391 steps/day) and increased for route (968 steps/day; t = 3.9, p < 0.000) and incidental (699 steps/day; t = 2.5, p < 0.014) groups. There were no significant changes for reported sitting times, but average values did decrease relative to the control (routes group = 7 minutes/day; incidental group = 15 minutes/day). Reductions were most evident for the incidental group in the first week of intervention, where reported sitting decreased by an average of 21 minutes/day (t = 1.9; p < 0.057). CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, both route and incidental walking increased physical activity in white-collar employees. Our data suggests that workplace walking, particularly through incidental movement, also has the potential to decrease employee sitting times, but there is a need for on-going research using concurrent and objective measures of sitting, standing and walking.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity is a risk factor for lipoprotein disorders and the metabolic syndrome. Physical inactivity has a powerful effect on suppressing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in skeletal muscle, the rate-limiting enzyme for hydrolysis of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. We tested the ability of several compounds to prevent the decrease in LPL. The present study minimized standing and ordinary light nonexercise movements in rats to compare the effects of inactivity and nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) on LPL activity. The key new insight was that the typically quick decrease in LPL activity of oxidative muscle caused by physical inactivity was prevented by nicotinic acid (NA), whereas inhibitors of TNF-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and NF-kappaB had no such effect. NA was administered at a dose known to acutely impede the appearance of plasma TG from the liver and free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and it was effective at intentionally lowering plasma lipid concentrations to the same level in active and inactive groups. As measured from heparin-releasable LPL activity, LPL in the microvasculature of the most oxidative muscles was approximately 90{\%} lower in the inactive group compared with controls, and this suppression was completely blocked by NA. In contrast to inactivity, NA did not raise muscle LPL in ambulatory controls, whereas a large exogenous fat delivery did decrease LPL activity. In vitro control studies revealed that NA did not have a direct effect on skeletal muscle LPL activity. In conclusion, physical inactivity amplifies the ability of plasma lipids to suppress muscle LPL activity. The light ambulatory contractions responsible for NEAT are sufficient for mitigating these deleterious effects.},

abstract = {How do healthcare providers know if their patients are getting enough physical activity to promote good health and to reduce their risks of chronic diseases and injury? The first step is to identify the patient's current level of physical activity using questionnaires and/or motion sensors. Questionnaires assess activity levels by having patients answer a set of questions about the types and amounts of activity performed at some time in the past. Motion sensors assess physical activity by patients wearing a small monitoring device that records their body movement as it occurs. If a provider is interested in determining a patient's caloric energy expenditure, he/she can apply statistical regression models to the questionnaire and motion sensor data to estimate kilocalories. If more precise measures of energy expenditure are desired, a provider can use the isotopic doubly labelled water method to estimate kilocalories; however, this method is costly and is impractical in non-research clinical settings.},

@article{Bey2003,
abstract = {We have examined the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in skeletal muscle during physical inactivity in comparison to low-intensity contractile activity of ambulatory controls. From studies acutely preventing ambulatory activity of one or both the hindlimbs in rats, it was shown that approximately 90-95 {\%} of the heparin-releasable (HR) LPL activity normally present in rat muscle with ambulatory activity is lost, and thus dependent on local contractile activity. Similarly, approximately 95 {\%} of the differences in LPL activity between muscles of different fibre types was dependent on ambulatory activity. The robustness of the finding that physical inactivity significantly decreases muscle LPL activity was evident from confirmatory studies with different models of inactivity, in many rats and mice, both sexes, three muscle types and during both acute and chronic (11 days) treatment. Inactivity caused a local reduction of plasma [3H]triglyceride uptake into muscle and a decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. LPL mRNA was not differentially expressed between ambulatory controls and either the acutely or chronically inactive groups. Instead, the process involved a rapid loss of the HR-LPL protein mass (the portion of LPL largely associated with the vascular endothelium) by an actinomycin D-sensitive signalling mechanism (i.e. transcriptionally dependent process). Significant decreases of intracellular LPL protein content lagged behind the loss of HR-LPL protein. Treadmill walking raised LPL activity approximately 8-fold (P < 0.01) within 4 h after inactivity. The striking sensitivity of muscle LPL to inactivity and low-intensity contractile activity may provide one piece of the puzzle for why inactivity is a risk factor for metabolic diseases and why even non-vigorous activity provides marked protection against disorders involving poor lipid metabolism.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: To examine the relationship of self-reported television (TV) viewing time with accelerometer-derived total sedentary time, and to determine whether it differs by subgroup. METHODS:: Using data for adults (≥ 20 years) from the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 nationally-representative US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES; n=5738), linear regression models examined the associations of categories of self-reported TV viewing time (<1, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+ hrs/day) with accelerometer-derived sedentary time (<100 counts/min; hrs/day). Spearman's rho assessed the correlation between participants' rankings on the two measures. Analyses were stratified by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and, in the 2003-2004 NHANES cycle, by work status among working-aged adults (20-65years, n=2069). RESULTS:: TV viewing time was significantly associated with sedentary time, with positive associations for all gender, age, race/ethnicity groups, and for those not working or working part-time, but not for those in full-time work. However, correlations between rankings of the measures were only 'fair' overall (rho=0.22) and were similar for all gender and racial/ethnic groups, and for those of mid and older-age, but not for those of younger age (20-39 yrs, rho=0.05). In the working-aged subgroup, there was also a 'fair' correlation between the measures for those not working (rho=0.22), but no significant correlation for those in part-time (rho=0.14) or full-time work (rho=0.03). CONCLUSIONS:: Associations of TV viewing time with accelerometer-derived total sedentary time were statistically significant, but correlations were of only fair magnitude and the strength of the relationship was not consistent across all population subgroups. These findings suggest TV viewing time has an influence on overall sedentary time at a population level; however, measurement of sedentary time in other domains is also important.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This study examined the association between objectively measured sedentary activity and metabolic syndrome among older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were from 1,367 men and women, aged ≥60 years who participated in the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Sedentary time during waking hours was measured by an accelerometer (<100 counts per minute). A sedentary bout was defined as a period of time >5 min. A sedentary break was defined as an interruption in sedentary time (≥100 counts per minute). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria. RESULTS On average, people spent 9.5 h (65{\%} of wear time) as sedentary. Compared with people without metabolic syndrome, people with metabolic syndrome spent a greater percentage of time as sedentary (67.3 vs. 62.2{\%}), had longer average sedentary bouts (17.7 vs. 16.7 min), had lower intensity during sedentary time (14.8 vs. 15.8 average counts per minute), and had fewer sedentary breaks (82.3 vs. 86.7), adjusted for age and sex (all P < 0.01). A higher percentage of time sedentary and fewer sedentary breaks were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of metabolic syndrome after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, alcohol consumption, smoking, BMI, diabetes, heart disease, and physical activity. The association between intensity during sedentary time and metabolic syndrome was borderline significant. CONCLUSIONS The proportion of sedentary time was strongly related to metabolic risk, independent of physical activity. Current results suggest older people may benefit from reducing total sedentary time and avoiding prolonged periods of sedentary time by increasing the number of breaks during sedentary time.},

This paper aims to document measures used to assess adults' time spent in leisure-time sedentary behaviours and to review the evidence on their reliability and validity. Medline, CINAHL and Psych INFO databases and reference lists from published papers were searched to identify studies in which leisure-time sedentary behaviours had been measured in adults. Sixty papers reporting measurement of at least one type of leisure-time sedentary behaviour were identified. Television viewing time was the most commonly measured sedentary behaviour. The main method of data collection was by questionnaire. Nine studies examined reliability and three examined validity for the questionnaire method of data collection. Test-retest reliabilities were predominantly moderate to high, but the validity studies reported large differences in correlations of self-completion questionnaire data with the various referent measures used. To strengthen future epidemiological and health behaviour studies, the development of reliable and valid self-report instruments that cover the full range of leisure-time sedentary behaviour is a priority.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective. To explore the association between home environmental variables and television (TV) time, and the mediating pathways underlying this association. Methods. The current study used data from the longitudinal ENDORSE study. Self-reported data was available for 1 265 adolescents (mean age of 12{\&}{\#}x2013;15 years at baseline) on home environment (availability of a TV in the bedroom, perceived parental modelling, family rules), potential mediators (intention, attitude, perceived behavioural control, subjective norm towards TV viewing) and TV viewing time. Mediation analyses were conducted using General Estimating Equations and mediation effects were calculated as the product-of-coefficients. Results. Significant overall positive associations were found for the presence of a TV in the bedroom and parental modelling with self-reported TV viewing. Controlling family rules showed an inverse association with reported TV time. Similarly, parental modelling and a TV in the bedroom were significantly positively associated with the Theory of Planned Behaviour variables and habit strength, while family rules showed an inverse association with these potential mediators. In turn, most potential mediators were positively associated with TV viewing. Intention, attitude and habit strength were the strongest mediators in all three associations explaining more than 55{\%} of the overall association. Habit strength alone explained 38.2{\%}{\&}{\#}x2013;58.0{\%} of the overall associations. Conclusions. Home and family environmental predictors of TV time among adolescents may be strongly mediated by habit strength and other personal factors. Future intervention studies should explore if changes in home and family environments indeed lead to reductions in TV time through these mediators.},

We systematically reviewed studies related to overweight in children that had included a measure of TV exposure.

Methods of assessing TV viewing were evaluated, including the type of measure, the administration procedure and reported psychometric properties. The majority of studies assessed TV viewing using self-report surveys and very few studies used direct observation. The validity or reliability of measures was often not examined. The majority of tools that were evaluated were compared with another self-report measure or an objective measure of physical activity. TV viewing measures should be selected that are specific to the research question, the study design, as well as methodological feasibility. However, it is recommended that measures of TV viewing be used only if they have psychometric data to support their validity and reliability. Selecting measures that are valid and reliable enables us to examine with greater accuracy the influence of TV viewing on childhood overweight, as well as the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce TV viewing in children.},

abstract = {Context: Abdominal obesity is a major risk factor for muscle insulin resistance. Mitochondria may play a key role in this etiology. Objective: Changes in muscle mitochondrial content and function were examined according to abdominal obesity and insulin sensitivity in men. Study Design and Setting: The descriptive MitHyCal study was conducted on the general population of Clermont-Ferrand, France. Participants: Forty-two healthy sedentary men (41.7 +/- 4.3 yr) were divided into four groups according to waist circumference: 87 cm or less (group 1, n = 10); 88-93 cm (group 2, n = 12); 94-101 cm (group 3, n = 10); and 102 cm or greater (group 4, n = 10). Intervention: Plasma metabolic check-up was performed, and insulin sensitivity index was calculated from glucose and insulin responses to a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. Muscle biopsies were obtained to assess mitochondrial content, oxidative phosphorylation activity, and superoxide anion (reactive oxygen species) production. Main Outcome Measures: Assessment of muscle mitochondrial content and function was planned before data collection began. Results: Abdominal obesity was negatively correlated to insulin sensitivity index (r = $\backslash$-0.39; P < 0.01), and only group 4 was insulin-resistant (P < 0.05). There were no between-group differences in muscle mitochondrial content and maximal activity of key oxidative enzymes. In contrast, muscle mitochondrial ADP-stimulated respiration rate was 24{\%} higher in groups 2 and 3 compared to groups 1 and 4 (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial ATP and reactive oxygen species production rates were 27 and 48{\%} lower in group 4 than in group 1 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Abdominal obesity is associated with alterations in intrinsic muscle mitochondrial function but not content. These adaptations mainly result in reduced mitochondrial ATP production rate in response to insulin resistance.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the 'activPAL Professional' physical activity logger by comparing its output to that of a proven discrete accelerometer-based activity monitor during extended measurements on healthy subjects while performing activities of daily living (ADL). Ten healthy adults, with unrestricted mobility, wore both the activPAL and the discrete dual accelerometer (Analog Devices ADXL202)-based activity monitor that recorded in synchronization with each other. The accelerometer derived data were then compared to that generated by the activPAL and a complete statistical and error analysis was performed using a Matlab program. This program determined trunk and thigh inclination angles to distinguish between sitting/lying, standing and stepping for the discrete accelerometer device and amount of time spent on each activity. Analysis was performed on a second-by-second basis and then categorized at 15s intervals in direct comparison with the activPAL generated data. Of the total time monitored (approximately 60 h) the detection accuracies for static and dynamic activities were approximately 98{\%}. In a population of healthy adults, the data obtained from the activPAL Professional physical activity logger for both static and dynamic activities showed a close match to a proven discrete accelerometer data with an offset of approximately 2{\%} between the two systems.},

abstract = {The aim of this systematic review was to describe the prospective relationship between childhood sedentary behaviour and health indicators. We identified prospective studies from searches in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycInfo and Cochrane, from January 1989 through April 2010. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts for eligibility, rated the methodological quality of the studies, and extracted data. We identified 31 papers, examining 27 different cohorts. The quality score of the studies ranged from 38 to 88{\%}. Nine studies were scored as high quality. According to the best evidence synthesis we found insufficient evidence for a longitudinal positive relationship between 'sedentary time'- mainly TV viewing - and body mass index (BMI) and more specific indicators of fat mass. One high quality and two low quality studies found a significant inverse relationship between sedentary time - mainly TV viewing - and aerobic fitness, leading to moderate evidence for this inverse relationship. There was insufficient evidence for a longitudinal relationship between sedentary time and blood pressure, blood lipids or bone mass. Our systematic review suggests that there is moderate evidence for a longitudinal inverse relationship between screen time and aerobic fitness during childhood. Thus there is evidence to limit screen time in young people in order to prevent low levels of fitness. The possible detrimental health effects of prolonged or excessive sitting on other health indicators needs further study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Before starting interventions addressing energy-balance related behaviors, knowledge is needed about the prevalence of sedentary behaviors and low physical exercise, their interrelationships, possible gender differences. Therefore this study aimed to describe gender differences in sedentary and physical exercise behaviors and their association with overweight status in children from nine European countries. Additionally, to identify clusters of children sharing the same pattern regarding sedentary and physical exercise behavior and compare these groups regarding overweight status. METHODS: Cross-sectional study among 11-year-old children in nine countries (n = 12538). Self-administered questionnaires assessed the time spent on TV viewing during dinner and during the day, PC use and on physical exercise. The parents reported children's weight and height. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and logistic regression analyses were used for data analyses. RESULTS: Boys spent more time on sedentary behaviors but also more on physical exercise than girls. High TV viewing and low exercise behavior independently increased the risk of being overweight. Based on the behaviors, five clusters were identified. Among boys, clear associations with being overweight were found, with the most unhealthy behavior pattern having the highest risks of being overweight. Among girls, high TV viewers and high PC users had increased risk of being overweight. In girls sedentary behaviors seemed more important than physical exercise with regard to overweight status. CONCLUSION: Despite selective non-response on BMI and reliance on self-reports, the associations between clusters and overweight in boys were clear, and differences between boys and girls regarding the behaviors and risks for overweight are noteworthy. These differences need to be considered when developing tailored intervention strategies for prevention of overweight.},

abstract = {Aims Prolonged sedentary time is ubiquitous in developed economies and is associated with an adverse cardio-metabolic risk profile and premature mortality. This study examined the associations of objectively assessed sedentary time and breaks (interruptions) in sedentary time with continuous cardio-metabolic and inflammatory risk biomarkers, and whether these associations varied by sex, age, and/or race/ethnicity. Methods and results Cross-sectional analyses with 4757 participants (≥20 years) from the 2003/04 and 2005/06 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An Actigraph accelerometer was used to derive sedentary time [<100 counts per minute (cpm)] and breaks in sedentary time. Independent of potential confounders, including moderate-to-vigorous exercise, detrimental linear associations (P for trends <0.05) of sedentary time with waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, triglycerides, insulin, HOMA-{\%}B, and HOMA-{\%}S were observed. Independent of potential confounders and sedentary time, breaks were beneficially associated with waist circumference and C-reactive protein (P for trends <0.05). There was limited evidence of meaningful differences in associations with biomarkers by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Notable exceptions were sex-differences in the associations of sedentary time and breaks with HDL-cholesterol, and race/ethnicity differences in the association of sedentary time with waist circumference with associations detrimental in non-Hispanic whites, null in Mexican Americans, and beneficial in non-Hispanic blacks. Conclusion These are the first population-representative findings on the deleterious associations of prolonged sedentary time with cardio-metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. The findings suggest that clinical communications and preventive health messages on reducing and breaking up sedentary time may be beneficial for cardiovascular disease risk.},

abstract = {Many programs to increase physical activity have been evaluated in developed countries, where 'leisure time physical activity' is the most frequent domain for interventions. In developing countries, and also with reference to global obesity prevention, different kinds of interventions targeting 'total physical activity' are needed. This requires efforts across agencies and sectors, and in the domains of work, active transport, reduced sitting time, as well as leisure time physical activity promotion. In considering possible solutions, this commentary examined the use of complex systems, where integrated efforts across sectors and agencies might, in combination, contribute to increasing total physical activity. The key sets of actions required globally to increase physical activity were, in our opinion, [i] efforts to disseminate individual-level behavior change programs to reach much larger populations rather than volunteers, [ii] social marketing and mass communication campaigns to change social norms in the community and among professionals and policymakers, [iii] efforts to influence the social and physical environment to make them more conducive to physical activity, and [iv] the development and implementation of national physical activity plans and strategies, with sufficient timelines and resources to achieve measurable change.},

RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We developed a cut-off for accelerometry output (validation study) in 30 healthy 3 to 4 year olds, which provided highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of sedentary behavior relative to a criterion method of measurement, direct observation using the children's physical activity form. We then cross-validated the cut-off in an independent sample of healthy 3 to 4 year olds (n = 52). RESULTS: In the validation study, optimal sensitivity and specificity for the detection of sedentary behavior were obtained at an accelerometry output cut-off of <1100 counts/min. In the cross-validation, sensitivity was 83{\%}: 438/528 inactive minutes were correctly classified. Specificity was 82{\%}: 1251/1526 noninactive minutes were correctly classified using this cut-off. DISCUSSION: Sedentary behavior can be quantified objectively in young children using accelerometry. This new technique could be considered for a wide variety of applications in the etiology, prevention, and treatment of childhood obesity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of sedentary behavior on blood pressure (BP) in young children using different indicators of sedentariness. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A rural Midwestern US community. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3 to 8 years (N = 111). Intervention Adiposity was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Objective measurements of sedentary activity were obtained from the accelerometers that participants wore continuously for 7 days. Measurements of television (TV) viewing, computer, and screen time (TV + computer) were obtained via parent report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic and diastolic BP. RESULTS: The sample spent a mean of 5 hours per day in sedentary activities, of which 1.5 hours were screen time. Accelerometer-determined sedentary activity was not significantly related to systolic BP or diastolic BP after controlling for age, sex, height, and percentage of body fat. However, TV viewing and screen time, but not computer use, were positively associated with both systolic BP and diastolic BP after adjusting for potential confounders. Participants in the lowest tertile of TV and screen time had significantly lower levels of systolic and diastolic BP than participants in the upper tertile. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behaviors, particularly TV viewing and screen time, were associated with BP in children, independent of body composition. Other factors that occur during excessive screen time (eg, food consumption) should also be considered in the context of sedentary behavior and BP development in children.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: Although independent relationships between sitting behaviors (mainly television viewing) and health outcomes have been reported, few studies have examined the measurement properties of self-report sitting questions. This study assessed gender specific test-retest reliability and validity of a questionnaire that assessed time spent sitting on weekdays and weekend-days: 1) traveling to/from places; 2) at work; 3) watching television; 4) using a computer at home; and 5) for leisure, not including television. METHODS:: Test-retest reliability of domain-specific sitting-time (min/d) on week-days and weekend-days was assessed using data collected on two occasions (median 11 d apart). Validity of domain- specific self-reported sitting time on week-days and weekend-days was assessed against log data and sedentary accelerometer data. RESULTS:: Complete repeat questionnaire and log data were obtained from 157 women (aged 51-59 years) and 96 men (aged 45-63 years). Reliability coefficients were high for week-day sitting time at work, watching television and using a computer at home (rs=0.84-0.78), but lower for weekend-days across all domains (rs=0.23-0.74). Validity coefficients were highest for week-day sitting time at work and using a computer at home (rs=0.69-0.74). With the exception of computer use and watching television for women, validity of the weekend-day sitting time items were low. CONCLUSIONS:: This study confirms the importance of measuring domain- and day-specific sitting time. The measurement properties of questions that assess structured domain-specific and week-day sitting time were acceptable and may be used in future studies that aim to elucidate associations between domain-specific sitting and health outcomes.},

Evidence supports that reducing time spent sitting, regardless of activity, may improve the metabolic consequences of obesity. Analyses were conducted in a large prospective study of US adults enrolled by the American Cancer Society to examine leisure time spent sitting and physical activity in relation to mortality. Time spent sitting and physical activity were queried by questionnaire on 53,440 men and 69,776 women who were disease free at enrollment. The authors identified 11,307 deaths in men and 7,923 deaths in women during the 14-year follow-up. After adjustment for smoking, body mass index, and other factors, time spent sitting ([{\&}ge;]6 vs. <3 hours/day) was associated with mortality in both women (relative risk = 1.34, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.44) and men (relative risk = 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.11, 1.24). Relative risks for sitting ([{\&}ge;]6 hours/day) and physical activity (<24.5 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week) combined were 1.94 (95{\%} CI: 1.70, 2.20) for women and 1.48 (95{\%} CI: 1.33, 1.65) for men, compared with those with the least time sitting and most activity. Associations were strongest for cardiovascular disease mortality. The time spent sitting was independently associated with total mortality, regardless of physical activity level. Public health messages should include both being physically active and reducing time spent sitting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence on the correlates of objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in childhood is limited. This study aimed to identify correlates of physical activity and sedentary behaviour among 7-year-old children in England. METHODS: Physical activity was measured using Actigraph accelerometry in 480 participants as part of the Gateshead Millennium Study during 2006-07. Twenty-two potential correlates across five domains (demographic and biological; psychological, cognitive and emotional; behavioural; social and cultural; physical environmental) were tested for associations with total volume of habitual physical activity, moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behaviour. Multiple linear regression analysis was used. RESULTS: Seven correlates, including four that are potentially modifiable, were significantly associated with total physical activity, MVPA and sedentary behaviour in final models: gender, child weight status, maternal age, child interest in active play, active commuting to school, parenting practice and season. Four of these variables were significantly associated with all three constructs in final models. The final models explained 18, 18 and 24{\%} of variance in total volume of physical activity, MVPA and sedentary behaviour, respectively. CONCLUSION: A number of potentially modifiable factors are associated with increased physical activity and/or reduced sedentary behaviour in English children. These could be valuable targets of future interventions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the empirical evidence concerning the strength of tracking of sedentary behaviors from childhood and adolescence. METHODS: Published English language studies were located from computerised and manual searches in 2009. Included studies were prospective, longitudinal studies with at least one sedentary behavior for at least two time-points, with tracking coefficients reported, and included children (aged 3-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years) at baseline. RESULTS: Based on data from 21 independent samples, tracking coefficients (r) ranged from 0.08 (over 16 years) to 0.73 (over 2 years) for TV viewing, from 0.18 (boys over 3 years) to 0.52 (over 2 years) for electronic game/computer use, from 0.16 (girls over 4 years) to 0.65 (boys over 2 years) for total screen time, and from -0.15 (boys over 2 years) to 0.48 (over 1 year) for total sedentary time. Study follow-up periods ranged from 1 to upto 27 years, and tracking coefficients tended to be higher with shorter follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behaviors track at moderate levels from childhood or adolescence. Data suggest that sedentary behaviors may form the foundation for such behaviors in the future and some may track slightly better than physical activity.},

abstract = {Activity-related energy expenditure (AEE) is difficult to quantify, especially under sedentary conditions. Here, a model was developed using the detected type of physical activity (PA) and movement intensity (MI), based on a tri-axial seismic accelerometer (DynaPort MiniMod; McRoberts B.V., The Hague, the Netherlands), with energy expenditure for PA as a reference. The relation between AEE (J/min/kg), MI, and the type of PA was determined for standardized PAs as performed in a laboratory including: lying, sitting, standing, and walking. AEE (J/min/kg) was calculated from total energy expenditure (TEE) and sleeping metabolic rate (SMR) as assessed with indirect calorimetry ((TEEx0.9)-SMR). Subsequently, the model was validated over 23-h intervals in a respiration chamber. Subjects were 15 healthy women (age: 22+/-2 years; BMI: 24.0+/-4.0 kg/m2). Predicted AEE in the chamber was significantly related to measured AEE both within (r2=0.81+/-0.06, P<0.00001) and between (r2=0.70, P<0.001) subjects. The explained variation in AEE by the model was higher than the explained variation by MI alone. This shows that a tri-axial seismic accelerometer is a valid tool for estimating AEE under sedentary conditions.},

Workers (N = 185) wore a pedometer for 7 days and recorded the number of steps taken and time spent sitting each day. Average time spent sitting on weekdays was 9.4 (SD = 2.40) hr, with about half spent sitting at work. Despite this, the average steps taken each day (M = 8,873, SD = 2,757) was higher on weekdays than on weekend days. There was a clear inverse relationship between sitting time at work and number of steps taken on weekdays, r = -.34, p < .001); those in the highest tertile for sitting time reported about 3,000 fewer daily steps. Workers in managerial and professional occupations reported more time sitting at work (M = 6.2 hr per day) and lower weekday step counts (M = 7,883, N = 43) than technical (M = 3.3 hr sitting at work and 10,731 weekday steps, N = 33) and blue collar workers (M = 1.6 hours sitting and 11,784 steps, N = 11). The findings suggest those whose daily work involves long hours of sitting should be the focus of efforts to promote physical activity both within and outside the workplace.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of sedentary behavior on blood pressure (BP) in young children using different indicators of sedentariness. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A rural Midwestern US community. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3 to 8 years (N = 111). Intervention Adiposity was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Objective measurements of sedentary activity were obtained from the accelerometers that participants wore continuously for 7 days. Measurements of television (TV) viewing, computer, and screen time (TV + computer) were obtained via parent report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic and diastolic BP. RESULTS: The sample spent a mean of 5 hours per day in sedentary activities, of which 1.5 hours were screen time. Accelerometer-determined sedentary activity was not significantly related to systolic BP or diastolic BP after controlling for age, sex, height, and percentage of body fat. However, TV viewing and screen time, but not computer use, were positively associated with both systolic BP and diastolic BP after adjusting for potential confounders. Participants in the lowest tertile of TV and screen time had significantly lower levels of systolic and diastolic BP than participants in the upper tertile. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behaviors, particularly TV viewing and screen time, were associated with BP in children, independent of body composition. Other factors that occur during excessive screen time (eg, food consumption) should also be considered in the context of sedentary behavior and BP development in children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of physical activity patterns can be used to identify sedentary behaviour and may facilitate interventions aimed at reducing inactivity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activPAL physical activity monitor as a measure of posture and motion in everyday activities using observational analysis as the criterion standard. METHODS: Wearing three activPAL monitors, 10 healthy participants performed a range of randomly assigned everyday tasks incorporating walking, standing and sitting. Each trial was captured on a digital camera and the recordings were synchronised with the activPAL. The time spent in different postures was visually classified and this was compared with the activPAL output. RESULTS: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2,1) for interdevice reliability ranged from 0.79 to 0.99. Using the Bland and Altman method, the mean percentage difference between the activPAL monitor and observation for total time spent sitting was 0.19{\%} (limits of agreement -0.68{\%} to 1.06{\%}) and for total time spent upright was -0.27{\%} (limits of agreement -1.38{\%} to 0.84{\%}). The mean difference for total time spent standing was 1.4{\%} (limits of agreement -6.2{\%} to 9.1{\%}) and for total time spent walking was -2.0{\%} (limits of agreement -16.1{\%} to 12.1{\%}). A second-by-second analysis between observer and monitor found an overall agreement of 95.9{\%}. CONCLUSION: The activPAL activity monitor is a valid and reliable measure of posture and motion during everyday physical activities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) is widely used to assess risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Cut points for the classification of obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2) have been developed and validated among people of European descent. It is unknown whether these cut points are appropriate for non-European populations. We assessed the metabolic risk associated with BMI among South Asians, Chinese, Aboriginals, and Europeans. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly sampled 1078 subjects from 4 ethnic groups (289 South Asians, 281 Chinese, 207 Aboriginals, and 301 Europeans) from 4 regions in Canada. Principal components factor analysis was used to derive underlying latent or "hidden" factors associated with 14 clinical and biochemical cardiometabolic markers. Ethnic-specific BMI cut points were derived for 3 cardiometabolic factors. Three primary latent factors emerged that accounted for 56{\%} of the variation in markers of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and blood pressure. For a given BMI, elevated levels of glucose- and lipid-related factors were more likely to be present in South Asians, Chinese, and Aboriginals compared with Europeans, and elevated levels of the blood pressure-related factor were more likely to be present among Chinese compared with Europeans. The cut point to define obesity, as defined by distribution of glucose and lipid factors, is lower by approximately 6 kg/m2 among non-European groups compared with Europeans. CONCLUSIONS: Revisions may be warranted for BMI cut points to define obesity among South Asians, Chinese, and Aboriginals. Using these revised cut points would greatly increase the estimated burden of obesity-related metabolic disorders among non-European populations.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between physical activity and mortality in a 7-year follow-up of a sample of women more than 30 years of age (N = 6,620) from the Canada Fitness Survey cohort, which was initiated in 1981. Age-adjusted relative risks relating quartiles of average daily energy expenditure (kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per day) to mortality were estimated using logistic regression. Compared with the least active, the risk of all-cause mortality was 0.73 for those in the highest quartile (P for trend = 0.03). The associations were stronger for cardiovascular disease mortality (odds ratio = 0.51; P for trend = 0.01) and fatal myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 0.61; P for trend = 0.04) for those in the highest quartile. These relations were due mainly to the contribution of non-leisure (household chores) energy expenditure, which represented, on average, 82{\%} of women's total activity. The accompanying study on the same cohort by Villeneuve et al reported estimates based on a subset of leisure-time physical activity only, which underestimates the activity of many women (Villeneuve PJ, Morrison HI, Craig CL, Schaubel DE. Physical activity, physical fitness, and risk of dying. Epidemiology 1998;9;632-635). The resulting bias illustrates the importance of including non-leisure energy expenditure in the assessment of total activity. These data support the hypothesis that physical activity is inversely associated with risk of death in women.},

To examine NEAT's role in obesity, we recruited 10 lean and 10 mildly obese sedentary volunteers and measured their body postures and movements every half-second for 10 days. Obese individuals were seated, on average, 2 hours longer per day than lean individuals. Posture allocation did not change when the obese individuals lost weight or when lean individuals gained weight, suggesting that it is biologically determined.

The first step is to identify the patient's current level of physical activity using questionnaires and/or motion sensors. Questionnaires assess activity levels by having patients answer a set of questions about the types and amounts of activity performed at some time in the past. Motion sensors assess physical activity by patients wearing a small monitoring device that records their body movement as it occurs. If a provider is interested in determining a patient's caloric energy expenditure, he/she can apply statistical regression models to the questionnaire and motion sensor data to estimate kilocalories. If more precise measures of energy expenditure are desired, a provider can use the isotopic doubly labelled water method to estimate kilocalories; however, this method is costly and is impractical in non-research clinical settings.},

@article{Chaput2009b,
abstract = {The population statistics of most countries of the world are indicating that industrialization and computerization have been associated with an increase in sedentariness and more recently with a significant shift from healthy weight to overweight. In general, this change in the overweight/obesity prevalence is attributed by health professionals to suboptimal diet and physical activity practices. However, recent data raised the possibility that excess weight gain might also be the outcome of changes imposed by our '24-hour', hectic lifestyle. Parallel to an increase in body weight, one has observed a reduction in sleep time and an increase in knowledge-based work (KBW) that appear as a growing necessity in a context of economic competitiveness and globalization. Sleep and cognitive work both exert a trivial effect on energy expenditure and may thus be considered as sedentary activities. However, their respective effect on energy intake is opposite. Indeed, an increase in the practice of the most sedentary activity, i.e. sleep, is associated with a hormonal profile facilitating appetite control whereas KBW appears as a stimulus favoring a significant enhancing effect on food intake. Television viewing is another example of sedentary activity that has been shown to increase the intake of high-density foods. These observations demonstrate that the modern way of living has favored a change in human activities whose impact goes well beyond what has traditionally been attributed to a lack of physical exercise. Therefore, we will need to reconsider the notion of 'sedentariness' which includes several activities having opposing effects on energy balance.},

This requires efforts across agencies and sectors, and in the domains of work, active transport, reduced sitting time, as well as leisure time physical activity promotion. In considering possible solutions, this commentary examined the use of complex systems, where integrated efforts across sectors and agencies might, in combination, contribute to increasing total physical activity. The key sets of actions required globally to increase physical activity were, in our opinion, [i] efforts to disseminate individual-level behavior change programs to reach much larger populations rather than volunteers, [ii] social marketing and mass communication campaigns to change social norms in the community and among professionals and policymakers, [iii] efforts to influence the social and physical environment to make them more conducive to physical activity, and [iv] the development and implementation of national physical activity plans and strategies, with sufficient timelines and resources to achieve measurable change.},

From 1992 to 2001, 314 incident ovarian cancer cases were identified among 59,695 postmenopausal women who were cancer free at enrollment. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compute hazard rate ratios while adjusting for potential confounders.

abstract = {We have examined the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in skeletal muscle during physical inactivity in comparison to low-intensity contractile activity of ambulatory controls. From studies acutely preventing ambulatory activity of one or both the hindlimbs in rats, it was shown that approximately 90-95 {\%} of the heparin-releasable (HR) LPL activity normally present in rat muscle with ambulatory activity is lost, and thus dependent on local contractile activity. Similarly, approximately 95 {\%} of the differences in LPL activity between muscles of different fibre types was dependent on ambulatory activity. The robustness of the finding that physical inactivity significantly decreases muscle LPL activity was evident from confirmatory studies with different models of inactivity, in many rats and mice, both sexes, three muscle types and during both acute and chronic (11 days) treatment. Inactivity caused a local reduction of plasma [3H]triglyceride uptake into muscle and a decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. LPL mRNA was not differentially expressed between ambulatory controls and either the acutely or chronically inactive groups. Instead, the process involved a rapid loss of the HR-LPL protein mass (the portion of LPL largely associated with the vascular endothelium) by an actinomycin D-sensitive signalling mechanism (i.e. transcriptionally dependent process). Significant decreases of intracellular LPL protein content lagged behind the loss of HR-LPL protein. Treadmill walking raised LPL activity approximately 8-fold (P < 0.01) within 4 h after inactivity. The striking sensitivity of muscle LPL to inactivity and low-intensity contractile activity may provide one piece of the puzzle for why inactivity is a risk factor for metabolic diseases and why even non-vigorous activity provides marked protection against disorders involving poor lipid metabolism.},

abstract = {Accelerometers are often used to quantify the acceleration of the body in arbitrary units (counts) to measure physical activity (PA) and to estimate energy expenditure. The present study investigated whether the identification of types of PA with one accelerometer could improve the estimation of energy expenditure compared with activity counts. Total energy expenditure (TEE) of 15 subjects was measured with the use of double-labeled water. The physical activity level (PAL) was derived by dividing TEE by sleeping metabolic rate. Simultaneously, PA was measured with one accelerometer. Accelerometer output was processed to calculate activity counts per day (AC(D)) and to determine the daily duration of six types of common activities identified with a classification tree model. A daily metabolic value (MET(D)) was calculated as mean of the MET compendium value of each activity type weighed by the daily duration. TEE was predicted by AC(D) and body weight and by AC(D) and fat-free mass, with a standard error of estimate (SEE) of 1.47 MJ/day, and 1.2 MJ/day, respectively. The replacement in these models of AC(D) with MET(D) increased the explained variation in TEE by 9{\%}, decreasing SEE by 0.14 MJ/day and 0.18 MJ/day, respectively. The correlation between PAL and MET(D) (R(2) = 51{\%}) was higher than that between PAL and AC(D) (R(2) = 46{\%}). We conclude that identification of activity types combined with MET intensity values improves the assessment of energy expenditure compared with activity counts. Future studies could develop models to objectively assess activity type and intensity to further increase accuracy of the energy expenditure estimation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: This paper 1) provides the calibration procedures and methods for metabolic and activity monitor data collection, 2) compares measured MET values to the MET values from the Compendium of Physical Activities, and 3) examines the relationship between accelerometer output and METs for a range of physical activities METHODS:: Participants (n=277) completed 11 activities for seven minutes each from a menu of 23 physical activities. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured using a portable metabolic system and an accelerometer was worn. MET values were defined as follows; measuredMETs (VO2/measured RMR) and standardMETs (VO2/3.5ml.kg.min). For the total sample and by sub-group (age [young <40y], sex and BMI [normal-weight <25 kg.m]), measuredMETs and standardMETs were compared to the Compendium, using 95{\%} confidence intervals to determine statistical significance (alpha=0.05). Average count.min for each activity and the linear association between count.min and METs are presented. RESULTS:: Compendium METs were different than measured METs for 17/21 activities (81{\%}). The number of activities different than the Compendium were similar between sub-groups or when standard METs were used. The average counts for the activities ranged from 11 counts.min(dishes) to 7490 counts.min (2.23m.s, 3{\%}) The r between counts and METs was 0.65. CONCLUSIONS:: This study provides valuable information about data collection, metabolic responses, and accelerometer output for common physical activities in a diverse participant sample. The Compendium should be updated with additional empirical data and linear regression models are inappropriate for accurately predicting METs from accelerometer output.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the ability of alternative measures of physical activity and fitness to quantify associations with health outcomes. METHODS: Associations between a range of subjective and objective physical activity and fitness measures and cardiometabolic risk factors were examined using data from 1,631 Australians aged 26-36 years. Anthropometry, fitness, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipids were measured at study clinics. Participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day pedometer diaries; they also reported sedentary behavior (sitting, television viewing). RESULTS: In men and women, associations were strongest for fitness, with those in the highest (vs. lowest) fitness quarter having a 75{\%} to 80{\%} lower prevalence of two or more primary risk factors (waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin resistance). In men, a 60{\%} to 70{\%} reduced prevalence of two or more risk factors was observed across extreme quarters of IPAQ leisure, IPAQ vigorous, sitting duration, and pedometer measures. Similar reductions in prevalence were observed only across extreme quarters of pedometer activity and television viewing in women. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between alternative measures and cardiometabolic risk were relatively independent, suggesting that a range of physical activity and fitness measures may be needed to most accurately quantify associations between physical activity and health.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: Although independent relationships between sitting behaviors (mainly television viewing) and health outcomes have been reported, few studies have examined the measurement properties of self-report sitting questions. This study assessed gender specific test-retest reliability and validity of a questionnaire that assessed time spent sitting on weekdays and weekend-days: 1) traveling to/from places; 2) at work; 3) watching television; 4) using a computer at home; and 5) for leisure, not including television. METHODS:: Test-retest reliability of domain-specific sitting-time (min/d) on week-days and weekend-days was assessed using data collected on two occasions (median 11 d apart). Validity of domain- specific self-reported sitting time on week-days and weekend-days was assessed against log data and sedentary accelerometer data. RESULTS:: Complete repeat questionnaire and log data were obtained from 157 women (aged 51-59 years) and 96 men (aged 45-63 years). Reliability coefficients were high for week-day sitting time at work, watching television and using a computer at home (rs=0.84-0.78), but lower for weekend-days across all domains (rs=0.23-0.74). Validity coefficients were highest for week-day sitting time at work and using a computer at home (rs=0.69-0.74). With the exception of computer use and watching television for women, validity of the weekend-day sitting time items were low. CONCLUSIONS:: This study confirms the importance of measuring domain- and day-specific sitting time. The measurement properties of questions that assess structured domain-specific and week-day sitting time were acceptable and may be used in future studies that aim to elucidate associations between domain-specific sitting and health outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing levels of physical inactivity and sedentariness are contributing to the current overweight and obesity epidemic. In this paper, the findings of two recent studies are used to explore the relationships between sitting time (in transport, work and leisure), physical activity and body mass index (BMI) in two contrasting samples of adult Australians. METHODS: Data on sitting time, physical activity, BMI and a number of demographic characteristics were compared for participants in two studies-529 women who were participants in a preschool health promotion project ('mothers'), and 185 men and women who were involved in a workplace pedometer study ('workers'). Relationships between age, number of children, physical activity, sitting time, BMI, gender and work patterns were explored. Logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of being overweight or obese, among participants with different physical activity, sitting time and work patterns. RESULTS: The total reported time spent sitting per day (across all domains) was almost 6 h less among the mothers than the workers (P<0.001), and compared with the mothers, a significantly greater proportion of the workers was classified as overweight or obese (BMI > or =25 kg/m(2)). Univariate analysis found that, compared with men in full-time work, women who worked full-time (OR=0.42, CI: 0.24-0.74), part-time (OR=0.35, CI: 0.20-0.59) or in full-time home duties (OR=0.51, CI: 0.29-0.88) were about half as likely to be overweight or obese. Participants who reported high daily levels of sitting (> or =7.4 h) were also significantly more likely than those who reported 'low' levels (<4.7 h/day) to be overweight or obese (OR=1.68, CI: 1.16-2.42). Multivariate analysis (including physical activity, work patterns and sitting time) confirmed that full-time and part-time working women (but not 'home duties' women) were less likely to report BMI > or =25 kg/m(2) than full-time working men (full-time: OR=0.44, CI: 0.25-0.78; part-time: OR=0.45, CI: 0.24-0.86), but the OR for BMI > or =25 among those in the high sitting category was attenuated (OR=1.61, CI 0.96-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a need for inclusion of measures of both activity and inactivity in future studies, so that the complex relationships between these behavioural determinants of BMI can be clarified.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the association between sedentary behavior and obesity among 12-year-old children, while adjusting for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and other potential confounding variables. Cross-sectional analyses were carried out with data from 5,434 children who participated in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Fat mass was derived using dual-energy X-ray emission absorptiometry, and height and weight measurements were used to calculate BMI (kg/m(2)). The children wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The cut points for sedentary behavior and MVPA were <or=199 and >or=3,600 counts per minute (cpm), respectively. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs), adjusting for potential confounders of physical activity that included gender, social factors, early life factors, and maturation. The minimally adjusted association between sedentary behavior and obesity was positive, OR = 1.18 (1.08, 1.28). After adjusting for the series of potential confounders of physical activity the positive association remained, OR = 1.32 (1.14, 1.53). The crude association between 15 min of MVPA per day and obesity was negative, OR = 0.54 (0.48, 0.62). When 15 min of MVPA per day was additionally controlled for in the models, the positive associations between sedentary behavior and obesity were negated. Sedentary behavior was positively associated with obesity in the 12-year-old children, but this association was not independent of MVPA; low levels of MVPA among the sedentary children increased the odds of obesity. These findings support the importance of specifically engaging in MVPA during childhood to reduce the prevalence of obesity.},

abstract = {Obesity is a major health challenge facing the modern world. Some evidence points to obesity itself as the main driver of premature mortality. We propose that this view is oversimplified. For example, high levels of physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with lower mortality, even in those who are overweight or obese. To address this issue, we combine epidemiological and physiological evidence in a new paradigm that integrates excess calorie intake, sedentary behavior, and a maladaptive response to stress. Human physiology is optimized to allow large distances to be covered on foot every day in order to find enough food to sustain brain metabolism. Furthermore, when the body is immobilized by an injury, it triggers efficient life-saving metabolic and inflammatory responses. Both these critical adaptations are, however, confounded by a sedentary lifestyle. The implications of these issues for clinical trial design and epidemiologic data analysis are discussed in this article.},

All subjects continued their usual work and leisure-time activities whilst we measured daily activity and body postures for 10 days. The data supported our hypothesis that people sit more at work compared to leisure (597 +/- 122 min/day cf 484 +/- 83 min/day; P < 0.0001). The mean difference was 110 +/- 99 min/day. Similarly, work days were associated with less standing (341 +/- 97 min/day; P = 0.002) than leisure days (417 +/- 101 min/day). Although the walking bouts did not differ significantly between work and leisure (46 +/- 9 vs. 42 +/- 9 walking bouts/day); the mean free-living velocity of a walk at work was 1.08 +/- 0.28 mph and on leisure days was 0.94 +/- 0.24 mph (P = 0.03) and the average time spent walking was 322 +/- 91 min on work days and 380 +/- 108 min on leisure days (P = 0.03). Estimates of the daily energetic cost of walking approximated 527 +/- 220 kcal/day for work days and 586 +/- 326 kcal/day for leisure days (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). Work days are associated with more sitting and less walking/standing time than leisure days. We suggest a need to develop approaches to free people from their chairs and render them more active.},

We then cross-validated the cut-off in an independent sample of healthy 3 to 4 year olds (n = 52). RESULTS: In the validation study, optimal sensitivity and specificity for the detection of sedentary behavior were obtained at an accelerometry output cut-off of <1100 counts/min. In the cross-validation, sensitivity was 83{\%}: 438/528 inactive minutes were correctly classified. Specificity was 82{\%}: 1251/1526 noninactive minutes were correctly classified using this cut-off. DISCUSSION: Sedentary behavior can be quantified objectively in young children using accelerometry.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and metabolic syndrome in a representative sample of U.S. adults. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A total of 1626 men and women > or =20 years old from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2000 who attended the morning examination were evaluated. The metabolic syndrome was defined by using the definition from the National Cholesterol Education Program. RESULTS: In unadjusted analysis, participants who did not engage in any moderate or vigorous physical activity during leisure time had almost twice the odds of having metabolic syndrome [odds ratio (OR), 1.90; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.22 to 2.97] as those who reportedly engaged in > or =150 min/wk of such activity. Adjustment for age, sex, race or ethnicity, educational status, smoking status, and alcohol use attenuated the OR (OR, 1.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 2.45). Compared with participants who watched television or videos or used a computer <1 h/d outside of work, the adjusted ORs for having metabolic syndrome were 1.41 (95{\%} CI 0.80 to 2.51) for 1 h/d, 1.37 (95{\%} CI 0.85 to 2.20) for 2 h/d, 1.70 (95{\%} CI 0.92 to 3.14) for 3 h/d, and 2.10 (95{\%} CI 1.27 to 3.47) for > or =4 h/d. Additional adjustment for physical activity or sedentary behavior minimally affected the ORs. DISCUSSION: Sedentary behavior is an important potential determinant of the prevalence of the syndrome. Efforts to lessen the amount of time that U.S. adults spend watching television or videos or using a computer, especially if coupled to increases in physical activity, could result in substantial decreases in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity is a risk factor for lipoprotein disorders and the metabolic syndrome. Physical inactivity has a powerful effect on suppressing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in skeletal muscle, the rate-limiting enzyme for hydrolysis of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. We tested the ability of several compounds to prevent the decrease in LPL. The present study minimized standing and ordinary light nonexercise movements in rats to compare the effects of inactivity and nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) on LPL activity. The key new insight was that the typically quick decrease in LPL activity of oxidative muscle caused by physical inactivity was prevented by nicotinic acid (NA), whereas inhibitors of TNF-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and NF-kappaB had no such effect. NA was administered at a dose known to acutely impede the appearance of plasma TG from the liver and free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and it was effective at intentionally lowering plasma lipid concentrations to the same level in active and inactive groups. As measured from heparin-releasable LPL activity, LPL in the microvasculature of the most oxidative muscles was approximately 90{\%} lower in the inactive group compared with controls, and this suppression was completely blocked by NA. In contrast to inactivity, NA did not raise muscle LPL in ambulatory controls, whereas a large exogenous fat delivery did decrease LPL activity. In vitro control studies revealed that NA did not have a direct effect on skeletal muscle LPL activity. In conclusion, physical inactivity amplifies the ability of plasma lipids to suppress muscle LPL activity. The light ambulatory contractions responsible for NEAT are sufficient for mitigating these deleterious effects.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, colon cancer, breast cancer, dementia and depression constitute a cluster of diseases, which defines 'a diseasome of physical inactivity'. Both physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity, reflecting accumulation of visceral fat mass, are associated with the occurrence of the diseases within the diseasome. Physical inactivity appears to be an independent and strong risk factor for accumulation of visceral fat, which again is a source of systemic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and tumour growth. Evidence suggests that the protective effect of exercise may to some extent be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory effect of regular exercise, which can be mediated via a reduction in visceral fat mass and/or by induction of an anti-inflammatory environment with each bout of exercise. The finding that muscles produce and release myokines provides a conceptual basis to understand the mechanisms whereby exercise influences metabolism and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. According to our theory, contracting skeletal muscles release myokines, which work in a hormone-like fashion, exerting specific endocrine effects on visceral fat. Other myokines work locally within the muscle via paracrine mechanisms, exerting their effects on signalling pathways involved in fat oxidation.},

abstract = {The relationship between television (TV) viewing and overweight in children is likely to be influenced by the quality of measures used. We systematically reviewed studies related to overweight in children that had included a measure of TV exposure. Literature searches were conducted in MedLINE, PsychInfo, SportDiscus and ISIWeb of Science. Methods of assessing TV viewing were evaluated, including the type of measure, the administration procedure and reported psychometric properties. The majority of studies assessed TV viewing using self-report surveys and very few studies used direct observation. The validity or reliability of measures was often not examined. The majority of tools that were evaluated were compared with another self-report measure or an objective measure of physical activity. TV viewing measures should be selected that are specific to the research question, the study design, as well as methodological feasibility. However, it is recommended that measures of TV viewing be used only if they have psychometric data to support their validity and reliability. Selecting measures that are valid and reliable enables us to examine with greater accuracy the influence of TV viewing on childhood overweight, as well as the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce TV viewing in children.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The Australian Women's Activity Survey (AWAS) was developed based on a systematic review and qualitative research on how to measure activity patterns of women with young children (WYC). AWAS assesses activity performed across five domains (planned activities, employment, child care, domestic responsibilities, and transport) and intensity levels (sitting, light intensity, brisk walking, moderate intensity, and vigorous intensity) in a typical week in the past month. The purpose of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and criterion validity of the AWAS. METHODS: WYC completed the AWAS on two occasions 7 d apart (test-retest reliability protocol) and/or wore a Manufacturing Technology Inc. (MTI) ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 d in between (validity protocol). Forty WYC (mean age 35 +/- 5 yr) completed the test-retest reliability protocol and 75 WYC (mean age 33 +/- 5 yr) completed the validity protocol. Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) between AWAS administrations and Spearman's correlation coefficients (rs) between AWAS and MTI data were calculated. RESULTS: AWAS showed good test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.80 (0.65-0.89)) and acceptable criterion validity (rs = 0.28, P = 0.01) for measuring weekly health-enhancing physical activity. AWAS also provided repeatable and valid estimates of sitting time (test-retest reliability, ICC = 0.42 (0.13-0.64); criterion validity, rs = 0.32, (P = 0.006)). CONCLUSION: The measurement properties of the AWAS are comparable to those reported for existing self-report measures of physical activity. However, AWAS offers a more comprehensive and flexible alternative for accurately assessing different domains and intensities of activity relevant to WYC. Future research should investigate whether the AWAS is a suitable measure of intervention efficacy by examining its sensitivity to change.},

abstract = {Context: Abdominal obesity is a major risk factor for muscle insulin resistance. Mitochondria may play a key role in this etiology. Objective: Changes in muscle mitochondrial content and function were examined according to abdominal obesity and insulin sensitivity in men. Study Design and Setting: The descriptive MitHyCal study was conducted on the general population of Clermont-Ferrand, France. Participants: Forty-two healthy sedentary men (41.7 +/- 4.3 yr) were divided into four groups according to waist circumference: 87 cm or less (group 1, n = 10); 88-93 cm (group 2, n = 12); 94-101 cm (group 3, n = 10); and 102 cm or greater (group 4, n = 10). Intervention: Plasma metabolic check-up was performed, and insulin sensitivity index was calculated from glucose and insulin responses to a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. Muscle biopsies were obtained to assess mitochondrial content, oxidative phosphorylation activity, and superoxide anion (reactive oxygen species) production. Main Outcome Measures: Assessment of muscle mitochondrial content and function was planned before data collection began. Results: Abdominal obesity was negatively correlated to insulin sensitivity index (r = $\backslash$-0.39; P < 0.01), and only group 4 was insulin-resistant (P < 0.05). There were no between-group differences in muscle mitochondrial content and maximal activity of key oxidative enzymes. In contrast, muscle mitochondrial ADP-stimulated respiration rate was 24{\%} higher in groups 2 and 3 compared to groups 1 and 4 (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial ATP and reactive oxygen species production rates were 27 and 48{\%} lower in group 4 than in group 1 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Abdominal obesity is associated with alterations in intrinsic muscle mitochondrial function but not content. These adaptations mainly result in reduced mitochondrial ATP production rate in response to insulin resistance.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Interventions designed to increase workplace physical activity may not automatically reduce high volumes of sitting, a behaviour independently linked to chronic diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes. This study compared the impact two different walking strategies had on step counts and reported sitting times. METHODS: Participants were white-collar university employees (n = 179; age 41.3 +/- 10.1 years; 141 women), who volunteered and undertook a standardised ten-week intervention at three sites. Pre-intervention step counts (Yamax SW-200) and self-reported sitting times were measured over five consecutive workdays. Using pre-intervention step counts, employees at each site were randomly allocated to a control group (n = 60; maintain normal behaviour), a route-based walking group (n = 60; at least 10 minutes sustained walking each workday) or an incidental walking group (n = 59; walking in workday tasks). Workday step counts and reported sitting times were re-assessed at the beginning, mid- and endpoint of intervention and group mean+/- SD steps/day and reported sitting times for pre-intervention and intervention measurement points compared using a mixed factorial ANOVA; paired sample-t-tests were used for follow-up, simple effect analyses. RESULTS: A significant interactive effect (F = 3.5; p < 0.003) was found between group and step counts. Daily steps for controls decreased over the intervention period (-391 steps/day) and increased for route (968 steps/day; t = 3.9, p < 0.000) and incidental (699 steps/day; t = 2.5, p < 0.014) groups. There were no significant changes for reported sitting times, but average values did decrease relative to the control (routes group = 7 minutes/day; incidental group = 15 minutes/day). Reductions were most evident for the incidental group in the first week of intervention, where reported sitting decreased by an average of 21 minutes/day (t = 1.9; p < 0.057). CONCLUSION: Compared to controls, both route and incidental walking increased physical activity in white-collar employees. Our data suggests that workplace walking, particularly through incidental movement, also has the potential to decrease employee sitting times, but there is a need for on-going research using concurrent and objective measures of sitting, standing and walking.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Accelerometers were incorporated in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) study cycle for objective assessment of physical activity. This is the first time that objective physical activity data are available on a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. The use of accelerometers allows researchers to measure total physical activity, including light intensity and unstructured activities, which may be a better predictor of health outcomes than structured activity alone. The aim of this study was to examine objectively determined physical activity levels by sex, age and racial/ethnic groups in a national sample of U.S. adults. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2003-2004 NHANES, a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability sample of the U.S. population. Physical activity was assessed with the Actigraph AM-7164 accelerometer for seven days following an examination. 2,688 U.S. adults with valid accelerometer data (i.e. at least four days with at least 10 hours of wear-time) were included in the analysis. Mean daily total physical activity counts, as well as counts accumulated in minutes of light, and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity are presented by sex across age and racial/ethnic groups. Generalized linear modeling using the log link function was performed to compare physical activity in sex and racial/ethnic groups adjusting for age. RESULTS: Physical activity decreases with age for both men and women across all racial/ethnic groups with men being more active than women, with the exception of Hispanic women. Hispanic women are more active at middle age (40-59 years) compared to younger or older age and not significantly less active than men in middle or older age groups (i.e. age 40-59 or age 60 and older). Hispanic men accumulate more total and light intensity physical activity counts than their white and black counterparts for all age groups. CONCLUSION: Physical activity levels measured objectively by accelerometer demonstrated that Hispanic men are, in general, more active than their white and black counterparts. This appears to be in contrast to self-reported physical activity previously reported in the literature and identifies the need to use objective measures in situations where the contribution of light intensity and/or unstructured physical activity cannot be assumed homogenous across the populations of interest.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between objective measures of sedentary behavior and cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in adolescents. A secondary aim was to evaluate the degree of association between overall and abdominal adiposity and CRFs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 210 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Measurements were made of the sum of the skinfold thicknesses at six locations (sum6), waist circumference (WC), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoproteins A-1 and B-100. A CRF score was calculated from the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and TG, HDL-C and glucose levels. Sedentary behavior was assessed over 7 days using an accelerometer. Participants were divided into tertiles according to sedentary behavior and into low and high levels of overall (sum6) and abdominal (WC) adiposity. RESULTS: Adolescents with a high level of sedentary behavior had less favorable SBP, TG and glucose levels and CRF scores. Adolescents with a high level of overall adiposity demonstrated significant differences in five of the 11 variables analyzed (i.e. DBP, LDL-C, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score), while adolescents with a high level of abdominal adiposity had differences in eight (i.e. SBP, MAP, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score). Adolescents with high levels of both overall and abdominal adiposity and sedentary behavior had the least favorable CRF scores. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behavior was associated with CRFs in adolescents, especially in obese adolescents. Abdominal adiposity seemed to play a more significant role in the development of CRFs than overall adiposity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review factors contributing to variation in total daily energy expenditure and its primary components: (1) resting metabolic rate; (2) diet-induced thermogenesis; and (3) activity thermogenesis, including exercise energy expenditure and nonexercise activity. For each component, the expected magnitude of intra-individual variability is also considered. We also reviewed studies that quantified the variability in 24 h energy expenditure. RECENT FINDINGS: In humans, the coefficient of variation in the components of total daily energy expenditure is around 5-8{\%} for resting metabolic rate, 1-2{\%} for exercise energy expenditure, and around 20{\%} for diet-induced thermogenesis. The coefficient of variance for 24 h energy expenditure measured using a room calorimeter for resting metabolic rate is around 5-10{\%}. Thus, these measures are all rather reproducible. Total daily energy expenditure varies several-fold in humans, not due to variation in resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, or exercise thermogenesis, but rather, due to variations in nonexercise activity. A variety of factors impact nonexercise activity, including occupation, environment, education, genetics, age, gender, and body composition, but little is known about the magnitude of effect. SUMMARY: Resting metabolic rate, diet-induced thermogenesis, exercise energy expenditure, and 24 h energy expenditure are highly reproducible. Coefficient of variation is smallest for exercise energy expenditure, followed by resting metabolic rate, 24 h energy expenditure, and diet-induced thermogenesis. There is considerable variability in total daily energy expenditure, largely due to variations in nonexercise activity. Although the factors that impact upon nonexercise activity are understood, their contribution to variation in total daily energy expenditure is unclear.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We examined the covarying patterns of physical activity and sedentary behaviors among adolescents and their long-term maintenance. METHODS: Data came from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995-2002). We used latent class analysis to identify distinct covarying patterns in adolescence. Logistic regression models were used to predict odds of meeting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendations (> or = 5 bouts/week) and exceeding screen time guidelines (> 2 hours/day) 6 years later based on their adolescent class profile. RESULTS: Five classes for each gender were identified and labeled as low physical activity (PA)/low sedentary behaviors (SED), moderate (Mod) PA/high (HI) SED, Mod PA/low SED, HI PA/low SED, and HI PA (except skating/biking)/low SED. Compared with low PA/low SED, males and females in Mod PA/low SED, HI PA/low SED, and HI PA (except skating/biking)/low SED classes had increased odds of meeting MVPA recommendations in young adulthood. Mod PA/HI SED had higher odds of exceeding screen time guidelines in young adulthood (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for females: 1.67, 95{\%} CI: 1.00-2.81; AOR for males: 3.31, 95{\%} CI: 1.80-6.09). CONCLUSIONS: Findings are useful to aid the development of multifactorial interventions that promote physical activity and reduce screen time among adolescents transitioning to adulthood.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study examined parent-child attitudes on value of specific types and intensities of physical activity, which may explain gender differences in child activity, and evaluated physical activity as a mechanism to reduce time spent in sedentary behaviors. DESIGN: A community sample of 681 parents and 433 children (mean age 9.9 years) reported attitudes on importance of vigorous and moderate intensity team and individually performed sports/activities, as well as household chores. Separate structural models (LISREL 8.7) for girls and boys tested whether parental attitudes were related to child TV and computer via child attitudes, sport team participation, and physical activity, controlling for demographic factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Child 7-day physical activity, sport teams, weekly TV, computer. RESULTS: Parent-child attitude congruence was more prevalent among boys, and attitudes varied by ethnicity, parent education, and number of children. Positive parent-child attitudes for vigorous team sports were related to increased team participation and physical activity, as well as reduced TV and computer in boys and girls. Value of moderate intensity household chores, such as cleaning house and doing laundry, was related to decreased team participation and increased TV in boys. Only organized team sports, not general physical activity, was related to reduced TV and computer. CONCLUSION: Results support parents' role in socializing children's achievement task values, affecting child activity by transferring specific attitudes. Value of vigorous intensity sports provided the most benefits to activity and reduction of sedentary behavior, while valuing household chores had unexpected negative effects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Before starting interventions addressing energy-balance related behaviors, knowledge is needed about the prevalence of sedentary behaviors and low physical exercise, their interrelationships, possible gender differences. Therefore this study aimed to describe gender differences in sedentary and physical exercise behaviors and their association with overweight status in children from nine European countries. Additionally, to identify clusters of children sharing the same pattern regarding sedentary and physical exercise behavior and compare these groups regarding overweight status. METHODS: Cross-sectional study among 11-year-old children in nine countries (n = 12538). Self-administered questionnaires assessed the time spent on TV viewing during dinner and during the day, PC use and on physical exercise. The parents reported children's weight and height. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and logistic regression analyses were used for data analyses. RESULTS: Boys spent more time on sedentary behaviors but also more on physical exercise than girls. High TV viewing and low exercise behavior independently increased the risk of being overweight. Based on the behaviors, five clusters were identified. Among boys, clear associations with being overweight were found, with the most unhealthy behavior pattern having the highest risks of being overweight. Among girls, high TV viewers and high PC users had increased risk of being overweight. In girls sedentary behaviors seemed more important than physical exercise with regard to overweight status. CONCLUSION: Despite selective non-response on BMI and reliance on self-reports, the associations between clusters and overweight in boys were clear, and differences between boys and girls regarding the behaviors and risks for overweight are noteworthy. These differences need to be considered when developing tailored intervention strategies for prevention of overweight.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative accuracy during treadmill walking and motor vehicle travel of the ActivPAL(TM), PALlite(TM) and Digi-Walker(TM) accelerometers. METHODS: Forty healthy volunteers wearing all accelerometers undertook either five treadmill walks (n=20) at speeds ranging between 0.6-1.4m/s or a 15min motor vehicle journey (n=20). Step counts recorded by each accelerometer were compared to the actual step count determined by video analysis (treadmill walking) or to an actual step count of zero (motor vehicle). Mean percentage measurement error was calculated and compared between devices by one-way ANOVA and Student's t-test. RESULTS: For treadmill walking, the measurement error was lowest for the ActivPAL, with no significant differences between the ActivPAL and the PALlite monitors. The measurement error was significantly higher for the Digi-Walker at speeds of </=1m/s. During vehicle travel erroneous steps were recorded by the PALlite (254 steps) and Digi-Walker (25 steps), but not the AcitvPAL monitor (0 steps). CONCLUSIONS: The ActivPAL accelerometer accurately measures step count over a range of walking speeds and, unlike the other accelerometers tested, is not falsely triggered by motor vehicle travel.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine (1) the inter-relationships between socio-economic status (SES), physical activity, three different domains of sitting time (weekday, weekend day and leisure-time sitting), and being overweight or obese (body mass index>/=25 kg/m(2)); and (2) the potential mediation effects of sitting time in the relationship between socio-economic factors and being overweight or obese in working Australian adults. DESIGN: Observational epidemiological study. SUBJECTS: One thousand forty eight working adults. Using a multistage sampling design on neighbourhood SES, participants were from high and low SES neighbourhoods of an Australian capital city. MEASUREMENTS: Neighbourhood SES was assessed using census data; individual SES was based on self-reported educational attainment and household income. There were three sitting time variables: sitting time on weekdays, weekend days and in leisure time. Overweight and obesity were determined using self-reported body weight and height. RESULTS: Gender, age, neighbourhood SES, education, working hours and physical activity were independently associated with weekday, weekend day and leisure-related sitting time. With the exception of education and working hours, these variables were also independently associated with being overweight or obese. Leisure-time sitting was found to be a mediator in the relationships between gender, education and being overweight or obese. CONCLUSION: Strategies to promote less sitting in leisure time are required to combat overweight and obesity in Australian adults, especially among those from low SES neighbourhoods, and among those with high levels of education and income who work long hours.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of the 'activPAL Professional' physical activity logger by comparing its output to that of a proven discrete accelerometer-based activity monitor during extended measurements on healthy subjects while performing activities of daily living (ADL). Ten healthy adults, with unrestricted mobility, wore both the activPAL and the discrete dual accelerometer (Analog Devices ADXL202)-based activity monitor that recorded in synchronization with each other. The accelerometer derived data were then compared to that generated by the activPAL and a complete statistical and error analysis was performed using a Matlab program. This program determined trunk and thigh inclination angles to distinguish between sitting/lying, standing and stepping for the discrete accelerometer device and amount of time spent on each activity. Analysis was performed on a second-by-second basis and then categorized at 15s intervals in direct comparison with the activPAL generated data. Of the total time monitored (approximately 60 h) the detection accuracies for static and dynamic activities were approximately 98{\%}. In a population of healthy adults, the data obtained from the activPAL Professional physical activity logger for both static and dynamic activities showed a close match to a proven discrete accelerometer data with an offset of approximately 2{\%} between the two systems.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to compare the concurrent accuracy of the CSA accelerometer and the Yamax pedometer under two conditions: 1) on a treadmill at five different speeds and 2) riding in a motorized vehicle on paved roads. METHODS: In study 1, motion sensor performance was evaluated against actual steps taken during 5-min bouts at five different treadmill walking speeds (54, 67, 80, 94, and 107 m.min-1). In study 2, performance was evaluated during a roundtrip (drive 1 and drive 2) motor vehicle travel on paved roads (total distance traveled was 32.6 km or 20.4 miles). Any steps detected during motor vehicle travel were considered error. RESULTS: In study 1, the Yamax pedometer detected significantly (P < 0.05) fewer steps than actually taken at the slowest treadmill speed (54 m.min-1). Further, the pedometer detected fewer steps than the accelerometer at this speed (75.4{\%} vs 98.9{\%}, P < 0.05). There were no differences between instruments compared with actual steps taken at all other walking speeds. In study 2, the CSA detected approximately 17-fold more erroneous steps than the pedometer (approximately 250 vs 15 steps for the total distance traveled, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of the error (for either instrument) is not likely an important threat to the assessment of free-living ambulatory populations but may be a problem for pedometers when monitoring frail older adults with slow gaits. On the other hand, CSA accelerometers erroneously detect more nonsteps than the Yamax pedometer under typical motor vehicle traveling conditions. This threat to validity is likely only problematic when using the accelerometer to assess physical activity in sedentary individuals who travel extensively by motor vehicle.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Current public health campaigns to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes have largely focused on increasing exercise, but have paid little attention to the reduction of sedentary behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between various sedentary behaviors, especially prolonged television (TV) watching, and risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study conducted from 1992 to 1998 among women from 11 states in the Nurses' Health Study. The obesity analysis included 50 277 women who had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 and were free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer and completed questions on physical activity and sedentary behaviors at baseline. The diabetes analysis included 68 497 women who at baseline were free from diagnosed diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: During 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5{\%}) of 50 277 women who had a BMI of less than 30 in 1992 became obese (BMI > or =30). Overall, we documented 1515 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Time spent watching TV was positively associated with risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the multivariate analyses adjusting for age, smoking, exercise levels, dietary factors, and other covariates, each 2-h/d increment in TV watching was associated with a 23{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 17{\%}-30{\%}) increase in obesity and a 14{\%} (95{\%} CI, 5{\%}-23{\%}) increase in risk of diabetes; each 2-h/d increment in sitting at work was associated with a 5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-10{\%}) increase in obesity and a 7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-16{\%}) increase in diabetes. In contrast, standing or walking around at home (2 h/d) was associated with a 9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 6{\%}-12{\%}) reduction in obesity and a 12{\%} (95{\%} CI, 7{\%}-16{\%}) reduction in diabetes. Each 1 hour per day of brisk walking was associated with a 24{\%} (95{\%} CI, 19{\%}-29{\%}) reduction in obesity and a 34{\%} (95{\%} CI, 27{\%}-41{\%}) reduction in diabetes. We estimated that in our cohort, 30{\%} (95{\%} CI, 24{\%}-36{\%}) of new cases of obesity and 43{\%} (95{\%} CI, 32{\%}-52{\%}) of new cases of diabetes could be prevented by adopting a relatively active lifestyle (<10 h/wk of TV watching and > or =30 min/d of brisk walking). CONCLUSIONS: Independent of exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk. This study emphasizes the importance of reducing prolonged TV watching and other sedentary behaviors for preventing obesity and diabetes.},

RESULTS: Reliability of sitting time was acceptable for men and women. Correlations between total sitting and accelerometer counts/min <100 were significant for both long (r = .33) and short (r = .34) forms. There was no agreement between tertiles of sitting and the inactivity category (kappa = .02, P = .68). CONCLUSION: Sedentary behavior should be explicitly measured in population surveillance and research instead of being defined by lack of physical activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The possible benefit of lifetime physical activity (PA) in reducing prostate cancer incidence and mortality is unclear. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 45,887 men aged 45-79 years was followed up from January 1998 to December 2007 for prostate cancer incidence (n=2735) and to December 2006 for its subtypes and for fatal (n=190) prostate cancer. RESULTS: We observed an inverse association between lifetime (average of age 30 and 50 years, and baseline age) total PA levels and prostate cancer risk. Multivariate-adjusted incidence in the top quartile of lifetime total PA decreased by 16{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=2-27{\%}) compared with that in the bottom quartile. We also observed an inverse association between average lifetime work or occupational activity and walking or bicycling duration and prostate cancer risk. Compared with men who mostly sit during their main work or occupation, men who sit half of the time experienced a 20{\%} lower risk (95{\%} CI=7-31{\%}). The rate ratio linearly decreased by 7{\%} (95{\%} CI=1-12{\%}) for total, 8{\%} (95{\%} CI=0-16{\%}) for localised and 12{\%} (95{\%} CI=2-20{\%}) for advanced prostate cancer for every 30 min per day increment of lifetime walking or bicycling in the range of 30 to 120 min per day. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that not sitting for most of the time during work or occupational activity and walking or bicycling more than 30 min per day during adult life is associated with reduced incidence of prostate cancer.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is related to premature mortality, the relationship between sedentary behaviors and mortality has not been fully explored and may represent a different paradigm than that associated with lack of exercise. We prospectively examined sitting time and mortality in a representative sample of 17,013 Canadians 18-90 yr of age. METHODS: Evaluation of daily sitting time (almost none of the time, one fourth of the time, half of the time, three fourths of the time, almost all of the time), leisure time physical activity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption was conducted at baseline. Participants were followed prospectively for an average of 12.0 yr for the ascertainment of mortality status. RESULTS: There were 1832 deaths (759 of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 547 of cancer) during 204,732 person-yr of follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was a progressively higher risk of mortality across higher levels of sitting time from all causes (hazard ratios (HR): 1.00, 1.00, 1.11, 1.36, 1.54; P for trend <0.0001) and CVD (HR:1.00, 1.01, 1.22, 1.47, 1.54; P for trend <0.0001) but not cancer. Similar results were obtained when stratified by sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index. Age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates per 10,000 person-yr of follow-up were 87, 86, 105, 130, and 161 (P for trend <0.0001) in physically inactive participants and 75, 69, 76, 98, 105 (P for trend = 0.008) in active participants across sitting time categories. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a dose-response association between sitting time and mortality from all causes and CVD, independent of leisure time physical activity. In addition to the promotion of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and a healthy weight, physicians should discourage sitting for extended periods.},

abstract = {The obesity epidemic is attributed in part to reduced physical activity. Evidence supports that reducing time spent sitting, regardless of activity, may improve the metabolic consequences of obesity. Analyses were conducted in a large prospective study of US adults enrolled by the American Cancer Society to examine leisure time spent sitting and physical activity in relation to mortality. Time spent sitting and physical activity were queried by questionnaire on 53,440 men and 69,776 women who were disease free at enrollment. The authors identified 11,307 deaths in men and 7,923 deaths in women during the 14-year follow-up. After adjustment for smoking, body mass index, and other factors, time spent sitting ([{\&}ge;]6 vs. <3 hours/day) was associated with mortality in both women (relative risk = 1.34, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.25, 1.44) and men (relative risk = 1.17, 95{\%} CI: 1.11, 1.24). Relative risks for sitting ([{\&}ge;]6 hours/day) and physical activity (<24.5 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week) combined were 1.94 (95{\%} CI: 1.70, 2.20) for women and 1.48 (95{\%} CI: 1.33, 1.65) for men, compared with those with the least time sitting and most activity. Associations were strongest for cardiovascular disease mortality. The time spent sitting was independently associated with total mortality, regardless of physical activity level. Public health messages should include both being physically active and reducing time spent sitting.},

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association of leisure-time sedentary and non-sedentary activities with body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) and with the prevalence of obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2) in a sample of the 15 member states of the European Union. METHODS: Professional interviewers administered standardized in-home questionnaires to 15,239 men and women aged 15 years upwards, selected by a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling with quotas applied to ensure national and European representativeness. Energy expenditure during leisure time was calculated based on data on frequency of and amount of time participating in various physical activities, assigning metabolic equivalents (METS) to each activity. Sedentary lifestyle was assessed by means of self-reported hours spent sitting down during leisure time. Multiple linear regression models with BMI as the dependent variable, and logistic regression models with obesity (BMI>30 kg/m2) as the outcome, were fitted. RESULTS: Independent associations of leisure-time physical activity (inverse) and amount of time spent sitting down (direct) with BMI were found. The adjusted prevalence odds ratio (OR) for obesity was 0.52 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.64, P<0.001] for the upper quintile of physical activity (>30 METS) compared with the most physically inactive quintile (<1.75 METS). A positive independent association was also evident for the time spent sitting down, with an adjusted OR= 1.61(95{\%} CI: 1.33-1.95, P<0.001) for those who spent more than 35 h of their leisure time sitting down compared with those who spent less than 15 h. Conclusions: Obesity and higher body weight are strongly associated with a sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity in the adult population of the European Union. These results, however, need to be interpreted with caution due to the cross-sectional design. Nonetheless, they are consistent with the view that a reduction in energy expenditure during leisure time may be the main determinant of the current epidemic of obesity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing levels of physical inactivity and sedentariness are contributing to the current overweight and obesity epidemic. In this paper, the findings of two recent studies are used to explore the relationships between sitting time (in transport, work and leisure), physical activity and body mass index (BMI) in two contrasting samples of adult Australians. METHODS: Data on sitting time, physical activity, BMI and a number of demographic characteristics were compared for participants in two studies-529 women who were participants in a preschool health promotion project ('mothers'), and 185 men and women who were involved in a workplace pedometer study ('workers'). Relationships between age, number of children, physical activity, sitting time, BMI, gender and work patterns were explored. Logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of being overweight or obese, among participants with different physical activity, sitting time and work patterns. RESULTS: The total reported time spent sitting per day (across all domains) was almost 6 h less among the mothers than the workers (P<0.001), and compared with the mothers, a significantly greater proportion of the workers was classified as overweight or obese (BMI > or =25 kg/m(2)). Univariate analysis found that, compared with men in full-time work, women who worked full-time (OR=0.42, CI: 0.24-0.74), part-time (OR=0.35, CI: 0.20-0.59) or in full-time home duties (OR=0.51, CI: 0.29-0.88) were about half as likely to be overweight or obese. Participants who reported high daily levels of sitting (> or =7.4 h) were also significantly more likely than those who reported 'low' levels (<4.7 h/day) to be overweight or obese (OR=1.68, CI: 1.16-2.42). Multivariate analysis (including physical activity, work patterns and sitting time) confirmed that full-time and part-time working women (but not 'home duties' women) were less likely to report BMI > or =25 kg/m(2) than full-time working men (full-time: OR=0.44, CI: 0.25-0.78; part-time: OR=0.45, CI: 0.24-0.86), but the OR for BMI > or =25 among those in the high sitting category was attenuated (OR=1.61, CI 0.96-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest a need for inclusion of measures of both activity and inactivity in future studies, so that the complex relationships between these behavioural determinants of BMI can be clarified.},

abstract = {Obesity occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. Humans expend energy through purposeful exercise and through changes in posture and movement that are associated with the routines of daily life [called nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)]. To examine NEAT's role in obesity, we recruited 10 lean and 10 mildly obese sedentary volunteers and measured their body postures and movements every half-second for 10 days. Obese individuals were seated, on average, 2 hours longer per day than lean individuals. Posture allocation did not change when the obese individuals lost weight or when lean individuals gained weight, suggesting that it is biologically determined. If obese individuals adopted the NEAT-enhanced behaviors of their lean counterparts, they might expend an additional 350 calories (kcal) per day.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the ability of alternative measures of physical activity and fitness to quantify associations with health outcomes. METHODS: Associations between a range of subjective and objective physical activity and fitness measures and cardiometabolic risk factors were examined using data from 1,631 Australians aged 26-36 years. Anthropometry, fitness, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipids were measured at study clinics. Participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day pedometer diaries; they also reported sedentary behavior (sitting, television viewing). RESULTS: In men and women, associations were strongest for fitness, with those in the highest (vs. lowest) fitness quarter having a 75{\%} to 80{\%} lower prevalence of two or more primary risk factors (waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin resistance). In men, a 60{\%} to 70{\%} reduced prevalence of two or more risk factors was observed across extreme quarters of IPAQ leisure, IPAQ vigorous, sitting duration, and pedometer measures. Similar reductions in prevalence were observed only across extreme quarters of pedometer activity and television viewing in women. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between alternative measures and cardiometabolic risk were relatively independent, suggesting that a range of physical activity and fitness measures may be needed to most accurately quantify associations between physical activity and health.},

abstract = {PURPOSE:: To examine the convergent validity of the ActiGraph and activPAL accelerometers with the Bouchard Activity Record (BAR) in adults. Sedentary behavior and walking were evaluated in all instruments; standing and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was evaluated in only those that detected such variables. METHODS:: Thirty-two participants wore the accelerometers and completed the BAR concurrently for 1 day. Descriptive statistics and delta values were reported for all instruments. Summary time spent in sedentary behavior and walking was compared between all instruments using RMANOVA. Dependent t-tests were used to analyze summary time in 1) standing between activPAL and BAR and 2) MVPA between ActiGraph and BAR. Bland Altman plots were interpreted for systematic bias. On a detailed level, concurrent time interval data were compared using mean percent agreement and kappa statistics. RESULTS:: There was a significant difference found in summary time spent in sedentary behavior apparent between ActiGraph and activPAL as well as between ActiGraph and BAR. There was also a significant difference detected in time spent in walking, apparent between ActiGraph and activPAL and between ActiGraph and BAR. In the time interval analysis, mean percent agreement ranged from 54.0{\%} (for walking detected by ActiGraph and activPAL) to 86.7{\%} (for MVPA by ActiGraph and BAR). Kappa values ranged from 0.25 (for walking by ActiGraph and activPAL) to 0.70 (for sedentary behavior between activPAL and BAR). Differences were also found in standing and MVPA. CONCLUSIONS:: The activPAL and BAR showed convergence on both summary and concurrent time interval levels in both sedentary behavior and walking. The comparative discordance between activPAL and BAR with ActiGraph was likely a function of different approaches used to distinguish sedentary behavior from walking.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Although moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is related to premature mortality, the relationship between sedentary behaviors and mortality has not been fully explored and may represent a different paradigm than that associated with lack of exercise. We prospectively examined sitting time and mortality in a representative sample of 17,013 Canadians 18-90 yr of age. METHODS: Evaluation of daily sitting time (almost none of the time, one fourth of the time, half of the time, three fourths of the time, almost all of the time), leisure time physical activity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption was conducted at baseline. Participants were followed prospectively for an average of 12.0 yr for the ascertainment of mortality status. RESULTS: There were 1832 deaths (759 of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 547 of cancer) during 204,732 person-yr of follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, there was a progressively higher risk of mortality across higher levels of sitting time from all causes (hazard ratios (HR): 1.00, 1.00, 1.11, 1.36, 1.54; P for trend <0.0001) and CVD (HR:1.00, 1.01, 1.22, 1.47, 1.54; P for trend <0.0001) but not cancer. Similar results were obtained when stratified by sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index. Age-adjusted all-cause mortality rates per 10,000 person-yr of follow-up were 87, 86, 105, 130, and 161 (P for trend <0.0001) in physically inactive participants and 75, 69, 76, 98, 105 (P for trend = 0.008) in active participants across sitting time categories. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a dose-response association between sitting time and mortality from all causes and CVD, independent of leisure time physical activity. In addition to the promotion of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and a healthy weight, physicians should discourage sitting for extended periods.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, colon cancer, breast cancer, dementia and depression constitute a cluster of diseases, which defines 'a diseasome of physical inactivity'. Both physical inactivity and abdominal adiposity, reflecting accumulation of visceral fat mass, are associated with the occurrence of the diseases within the diseasome. Physical inactivity appears to be an independent and strong risk factor for accumulation of visceral fat, which again is a source of systemic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration and tumour growth. Evidence suggests that the protective effect of exercise may to some extent be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory effect of regular exercise, which can be mediated via a reduction in visceral fat mass and/or by induction of an anti-inflammatory environment with each bout of exercise. The finding that muscles produce and release myokines provides a conceptual basis to understand the mechanisms whereby exercise influences metabolism and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. According to our theory, contracting skeletal muscles release myokines, which work in a hormone-like fashion, exerting specific endocrine effects on visceral fat. Other myokines work locally within the muscle via paracrine mechanisms, exerting their effects on signalling pathways involved in fat oxidation.},

The authors examined the association among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and ovarian cancer risk in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective study of cancer incidence and mortality, using information obtained at baseline in 1992. From 1992 to 2001, 314 incident ovarian cancer cases were identified among 59,695 postmenopausal women who were cancer free at enrollment. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compute hazard rate ratios while adjusting for potential confounders. No overall association was observed between measures of past physical activity or with recreational physical activity at baseline and risk of ovarian cancer in this study (for the highest category of physical activity compared with none: hazard rate ratio = 0.73, 95{\%} confidence interval: 0.40, 1.34). However, a prolonged duration of sedentary behavior was associated with an increased risk (for > or = 6 vs. < 3 hours per day: hazard rate ratio = 1.55, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.08, 2.22; p(trend) = 0.01). Results from this study suggest that high levels of sedentary behavior may increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but they do not support a major impact of light and moderate physical activity on ovarian cancer risk.},

We examined the associations of prolonged television viewing time with all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and non-CVD/noncancer mortality in Australian adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: Television viewing time in relation to subsequent all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality (median follow-up, 6.6 years) was examined among 8800 adults > or =25 years of age in the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). During 58 087 person-years of follow-up, there were 284 deaths (87 CVD deaths, 125 cancer deaths). After adjustment for age, sex, waist circumference, and exercise, the hazard ratios for each 1-hour increment in television viewing time per day were 1.11 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.20) for all-cause mortality, 1.18 (95{\%} CI, 1.03 to 1.35) for CVD mortality, and 1.09 (95{\%} CI, 0.96 to 1.23) for cancer mortality. Compared with a television viewing time of <2 h/d, the fully adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.13 (95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 1.36) for > or =2 to <4 h/d and 1.46 (95{\%} CI, 1.04 to 2.05) for > or =4 h/d. For CVD mortality, corresponding hazard ratios were 1.19 (95{\%} CI, 0.72 to 1.99) and 1.80 (95{\%} CI, 1.00 to 3.25). The associations with both cancer mortality and non-CVD/noncancer mortality were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Television viewing time was associated with increased risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. In addition to the promotion of exercise, chronic disease prevention strategies could focus on reducing sitting time, particularly prolonged television viewing.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity is a risk factor for lipoprotein disorders and the metabolic syndrome. Physical inactivity has a powerful effect on suppressing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in skeletal muscle, the rate-limiting enzyme for hydrolysis of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. We tested the ability of several compounds to prevent the decrease in LPL. The present study minimized standing and ordinary light nonexercise movements in rats to compare the effects of inactivity and nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) on LPL activity. The key new insight was that the typically quick decrease in LPL activity of oxidative muscle caused by physical inactivity was prevented by nicotinic acid (NA), whereas inhibitors of TNF-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and NF-kappaB had no such effect. NA was administered at a dose known to acutely impede the appearance of plasma TG from the liver and free fatty acids from adipose tissue, and it was effective at intentionally lowering plasma lipid concentrations to the same level in active and inactive groups. As measured from heparin-releasable LPL activity, LPL in the microvasculature of the most oxidative muscles was approximately 90{\%} lower in the inactive group compared with controls, and this suppression was completely blocked by NA. In contrast to inactivity, NA did not raise muscle LPL in ambulatory controls, whereas a large exogenous fat delivery did decrease LPL activity. In vitro control studies revealed that NA did not have a direct effect on skeletal muscle LPL activity. In conclusion, physical inactivity amplifies the ability of plasma lipids to suppress muscle LPL activity. The light ambulatory contractions responsible for NEAT are sufficient for mitigating these deleterious effects.},

abstract = {The population statistics of most countries of the world are indicating that industrialization and computerization have been associated with an increase in sedentariness and more recently with a significant shift from healthy weight to overweight. In general, this change in the overweight/obesity prevalence is attributed by health professionals to suboptimal diet and physical activity practices. However, recent data raised the possibility that excess weight gain might also be the outcome of changes imposed by our '24-hour', hectic lifestyle. Parallel to an increase in body weight, one has observed a reduction in sleep time and an increase in knowledge-based work (KBW) that appear as a growing necessity in a context of economic competitiveness and globalization. Sleep and cognitive work both exert a trivial effect on energy expenditure and may thus be considered as sedentary activities. However, their respective effect on energy intake is opposite. Indeed, an increase in the practice of the most sedentary activity, i.e. sleep, is associated with a hormonal profile facilitating appetite control whereas KBW appears as a stimulus favoring a significant enhancing effect on food intake. Television viewing is another example of sedentary activity that has been shown to increase the intake of high-density foods. These observations demonstrate that the modern way of living has favored a change in human activities whose impact goes well beyond what has traditionally been attributed to a lack of physical exercise. Therefore, we will need to reconsider the notion of 'sedentariness' which includes several activities having opposing effects on energy balance.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between objective measures of sedentary behavior and cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in adolescents. A secondary aim was to evaluate the degree of association between overall and abdominal adiposity and CRFs. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 210 adolescents aged 13-17 years. Measurements were made of the sum of the skinfold thicknesses at six locations (sum6), waist circumference (WC), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoproteins A-1 and B-100. A CRF score was calculated from the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and TG, HDL-C and glucose levels. Sedentary behavior was assessed over 7 days using an accelerometer. Participants were divided into tertiles according to sedentary behavior and into low and high levels of overall (sum6) and abdominal (WC) adiposity. RESULTS: Adolescents with a high level of sedentary behavior had less favorable SBP, TG and glucose levels and CRF scores. Adolescents with a high level of overall adiposity demonstrated significant differences in five of the 11 variables analyzed (i.e. DBP, LDL-C, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score), while adolescents with a high level of abdominal adiposity had differences in eight (i.e. SBP, MAP, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG, TC, apolipoprotein B-100 and CRF score). Adolescents with high levels of both overall and abdominal adiposity and sedentary behavior had the least favorable CRF scores. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behavior was associated with CRFs in adolescents, especially in obese adolescents. Abdominal adiposity seemed to play a more significant role in the development of CRFs than overall adiposity.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Current public health campaigns to reduce obesity and type 2 diabetes have largely focused on increasing exercise, but have paid little attention to the reduction of sedentary behaviors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between various sedentary behaviors, especially prolonged television (TV) watching, and risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective cohort study conducted from 1992 to 1998 among women from 11 states in the Nurses' Health Study. The obesity analysis included 50 277 women who had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 30 and were free from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer and completed questions on physical activity and sedentary behaviors at baseline. The diabetes analysis included 68 497 women who at baseline were free from diagnosed diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Onset of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: During 6 years of follow-up, 3757 (7.5{\%}) of 50 277 women who had a BMI of less than 30 in 1992 became obese (BMI > or =30). Overall, we documented 1515 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Time spent watching TV was positively associated with risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the multivariate analyses adjusting for age, smoking, exercise levels, dietary factors, and other covariates, each 2-h/d increment in TV watching was associated with a 23{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 17{\%}-30{\%}) increase in obesity and a 14{\%} (95{\%} CI, 5{\%}-23{\%}) increase in risk of diabetes; each 2-h/d increment in sitting at work was associated with a 5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-10{\%}) increase in obesity and a 7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 0{\%}-16{\%}) increase in diabetes. In contrast, standing or walking around at home (2 h/d) was associated with a 9{\%} (95{\%} CI, 6{\%}-12{\%}) reduction in obesity and a 12{\%} (95{\%} CI, 7{\%}-16{\%}) reduction in diabetes. Each 1 hour per day of brisk walking was associated with a 24{\%} (95{\%} CI, 19{\%}-29{\%}) reduction in obesity and a 34{\%} (95{\%} CI, 27{\%}-41{\%}) reduction in diabetes. We estimated that in our cohort, 30{\%} (95{\%} CI, 24{\%}-36{\%}) of new cases of obesity and 43{\%} (95{\%} CI, 32{\%}-52{\%}) of new cases of diabetes could be prevented by adopting a relatively active lifestyle (<10 h/wk of TV watching and > or =30 min/d of brisk walking). CONCLUSIONS: Independent of exercise levels, sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk. This study emphasizes the importance of reducing prolonged TV watching and other sedentary behaviors for preventing obesity and diabetes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations among physical activity, sedentary behavior, and metabolic syndrome in a representative sample of U.S. adults. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A total of 1626 men and women > or =20 years old from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2000 who attended the morning examination were evaluated. The metabolic syndrome was defined by using the definition from the National Cholesterol Education Program. RESULTS: In unadjusted analysis, participants who did not engage in any moderate or vigorous physical activity during leisure time had almost twice the odds of having metabolic syndrome [odds ratio (OR), 1.90; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.22 to 2.97] as those who reportedly engaged in > or =150 min/wk of such activity. Adjustment for age, sex, race or ethnicity, educational status, smoking status, and alcohol use attenuated the OR (OR, 1.46; 95{\%} CI, 0.87 to 2.45). Compared with participants who watched television or videos or used a computer <1 h/d outside of work, the adjusted ORs for having metabolic syndrome were 1.41 (95{\%} CI 0.80 to 2.51) for 1 h/d, 1.37 (95{\%} CI 0.85 to 2.20) for 2 h/d, 1.70 (95{\%} CI 0.92 to 3.14) for 3 h/d, and 2.10 (95{\%} CI 1.27 to 3.47) for > or =4 h/d. Additional adjustment for physical activity or sedentary behavior minimally affected the ORs. DISCUSSION: Sedentary behavior is an important potential determinant of the prevalence of the syndrome. Efforts to lessen the amount of time that U.S. adults spend watching television or videos or using a computer, especially if coupled to increases in physical activity, could result in substantial decreases in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome.},

@article{Bey2003c,
abstract = {We have examined the regulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in skeletal muscle during physical inactivity in comparison to low-intensity contractile activity of ambulatory controls. From studies acutely preventing ambulatory activity of one or both the hindlimbs in rats, it was shown that approximately 90-95 {\%} of the heparin-releasable (HR) LPL activity normally present in rat muscle with ambulatory activity is lost, and thus dependent on local contractile activity. Similarly, approximately 95 {\%} of the differences in LPL activity between muscles of different fibre types was dependent on ambulatory activity. The robustness of the finding that physical inactivity significantly decreases muscle LPL activity was evident from confirmatory studies with different models of inactivity, in many rats and mice, both sexes, three muscle types and during both acute and chronic (11 days) treatment. Inactivity caused a local reduction of plasma [3H]triglyceride uptake into muscle and a decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. LPL mRNA was not differentially expressed between ambulatory controls and either the acutely or chronically inactive groups. Instead, the process involved a rapid loss of the HR-LPL protein mass (the portion of LPL largely associated with the vascular endothelium) by an actinomycin D-sensitive signalling mechanism (i.e. transcriptionally dependent process). Significant decreases of intracellular LPL protein content lagged behind the loss of HR-LPL protein. Treadmill walking raised LPL activity approximately 8-fold (P < 0.01) within 4 h after inactivity. The striking sensitivity of muscle LPL to inactivity and low-intensity contractile activity may provide one piece of the puzzle for why inactivity is a risk factor for metabolic diseases and why even non-vigorous activity provides marked protection against disorders involving poor lipid metabolism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Before starting interventions addressing energy-balance related behaviors, knowledge is needed about the prevalence of sedentary behaviors and low physical exercise, their interrelationships, possible gender differences. Therefore this study aimed to describe gender differences in sedentary and physical exercise behaviors and their association with overweight status in children from nine European countries. Additionally, to identify clusters of children sharing the same pattern regarding sedentary and physical exercise behavior and compare these groups regarding overweight status. METHODS: Cross-sectional study among 11-year-old children in nine countries (n = 12538). Self-administered questionnaires assessed the time spent on TV viewing during dinner and during the day, PC use and on physical exercise. The parents reported children's weight and height. Descriptive statistics, cluster analyses, and logistic regression analyses were used for data analyses. RESULTS: Boys spent more time on sedentary behaviors but also more on physical exercise than girls. High TV viewing and low exercise behavior independently increased the risk of being overweight. Based on the behaviors, five clusters were identified. Among boys, clear associations with being overweight were found, with the most unhealthy behavior pattern having the highest risks of being overweight. Among girls, high TV viewers and high PC users had increased risk of being overweight. In girls sedentary behaviors seemed more important than physical exercise with regard to overweight status. CONCLUSION: Despite selective non-response on BMI and reliance on self-reports, the associations between clusters and overweight in boys were clear, and differences between boys and girls regarding the behaviors and risks for overweight are noteworthy. These differences need to be considered when developing tailored intervention strategies for prevention of overweight.},

abstract = {Context: Abdominal obesity is a major risk factor for muscle insulin resistance. Mitochondria may play a key role in this etiology. Objective: Changes in muscle mitochondrial content and function were examined according to abdominal obesity and insulin sensitivity in men. Study Design and Setting: The descriptive MitHyCal study was conducted on the general population of Clermont-Ferrand, France. Participants: Forty-two healthy sedentary men (41.7 +/- 4.3 yr) were divided into four groups according to waist circumference: 87 cm or less (group 1, n = 10); 88-93 cm (group 2, n = 12); 94-101 cm (group 3, n = 10); and 102 cm or greater (group 4, n = 10). Intervention: Plasma metabolic check-up was performed, and insulin sensitivity index was calculated from glucose and insulin responses to a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test. Muscle biopsies were obtained to assess mitochondrial content, oxidative phosphorylation activity, and superoxide anion (reactive oxygen species) production. Main Outcome Measures: Assessment of muscle mitochondrial content and function was planned before data collection began. Results: Abdominal obesity was negatively correlated to insulin sensitivity index (r = $\backslash$-0.39; P < 0.01), and only group 4 was insulin-resistant (P < 0.05). There were no between-group differences in muscle mitochondrial content and maximal activity of key oxidative enzymes. In contrast, muscle mitochondrial ADP-stimulated respiration rate was 24{\%} higher in groups 2 and 3 compared to groups 1 and 4 (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial ATP and reactive oxygen species production rates were 27 and 48{\%} lower in group 4 than in group 1 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Abdominal obesity is associated with alterations in intrinsic muscle mitochondrial function but not content. These adaptations mainly result in reduced mitochondrial ATP production rate in response to insulin resistance.},

SETTING: A rural Midwestern US community. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3 to 8 years (N = 111). Intervention Adiposity was assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Objective measurements of sedentary activity were obtained from the accelerometers that participants wore continuously for 7 days. Measurements of television (TV) viewing, computer, and screen time (TV + computer) were obtained via parent report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic and diastolic BP. RESULTS: The sample spent a mean of 5 hours per day in sedentary activities, of which 1.5 hours were screen time. Accelerometer-determined sedentary activity was not significantly related to systolic BP or diastolic BP after controlling for age, sex, height, and percentage of body fat. However, TV viewing and screen time, but not computer use, were positively associated with both systolic BP and diastolic BP after adjusting for potential confounders. Participants in the lowest tertile of TV and screen time had significantly lower levels of systolic and diastolic BP than participants in the upper tertile. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary behaviors, particularly TV viewing and screen time, were associated with BP in children, independent of body composition. Other factors that occur during excessive screen time (eg, food consumption) should also be considered in the context of sedentary behavior and BP development in children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The RESIDential Environment project (RESIDE) is a longitudinal study evaluating the impact of a new residential design code on walking. OBJECTIVE: To develop a reliable measure of walking--undertaken within and outside the neighborhood--and overall physical activity. METHODS: A test-retest reliability study was undertaken (n = 82, mean age 39 years). The instrument was based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short version) and Active Australia Survey. It measured usual frequency and duration of (1) recreational- and transport-related walking within and outside the neighborhood and (2) other vigorous and moderate physical activities. RESULTS: Reliability of recall of whether participants had walked within (k = 0.84) and outside (0.73) the neighborhood was acceptable. Similarly, recall of frequency and duration of transport and recreational-related walking within the neighborhood was excellent (ICC > or = 0.82), as was recall of transport-related walking trips outside the neighborhood (ICC > or = 0.84). Reliability for duration of recreational walking outside the neighborhood was fair to good (ICC = 0.55). The reliability of indices of total physical activity based on MET min/week (ICC = 0.82) and MET min/week dichotomized to 'sufficient' physical activity for health (kappa = 0.67) were both acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: The Neighborhood Physical Activity Questionnaire (NPAQ) is sufficiently reliable for studies examining environmental correlates of walking within the neighborhood.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the strength of the relation between the amount of green space in people's living environment and their perceived general health. This relation is analysed for different age and socioeconomic groups. Furthermore, it is analysed separately for urban and more rural areas, because the strength of the relation was expected to vary with urbanity. DESIGN: The study includes 250 782 people registered with 104 general practices who filled in a self administered form on sociodemographic background and perceived general health. The percentage of green space (urban green space, agricultural space, natural green space) within a one kilometre and three kilometre radius around the postal code coordinates was calculated for each household. METHODS: Multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed at three levels-that is, individual level, family level, and practice level-controlled for sociodemographic characteristics. MAIN RESULTS: The percentage of green space inside a one kilometre and a three kilometre radius had a significant relation to perceived general health. The relation was generally present at all degrees of urbanity. The overall relation is somewhat stronger for lower socioeconomic groups. Elderly, youth, and secondary educated people in large cities seem to benefit more from presence of green areas in their living environment than other groups in large cities. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that the percentage of green space in people's living environment has a positive association with the perceived general health of residents. Green space seems to be more than just a luxury and consequently the development of green space should be allocated a more central position in spatial planning policy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Little is known regarding health-related quality of life and its relation with physical activity level in the general population. Our primary objective was to systematically review data examining this relationship. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for health-related quality of life and physical activity related keywords in titles, abstracts, or indexing fields. RESULTS: From 1426 retrieved references, 55 citations were judged to require further evaluation. Fourteen studies were retained for data extraction and analysis; seven were cross-sectional studies, two were cohort studies, four were randomized controlled trials and one used a combined cross sectional and longitudinal design. Thirteen different methods of physical activity assessment were used. Most health-related quality of life instruments related to the Medical Outcome Study SF-36 questionnaire. Cross-sectional studies showed a consistently positive association between self-reported physical activity and health-related quality of life. The largest cross-sectional study reported an adjusted odds ratio of "having 14 or more unhealthy days" during the previous month to be 0.40 (95{\%} Confidence Interval 0.36-0.45) for those meeting recommended levels of physical activity compared to inactive subjects. Cohort studies and randomized controlled trials tended to show a positive effect of physical activity on health-related quality of life, but similar to the cross-sectional studies, had methodological limitations. CONCLUSION: Cross-sectional data showed a consistently positive association between physical activity level and health-related quality of life. Limited evidence from randomized controlled trials and cohort studies precludes a definitive statement about the nature of this association.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional multilevel study was conducted. Participants included 1966 older adults in 50 neighborhoods. Socio-demographic covariates and BE attributes were measured. Multilevel logistic regression models were used for the analyses. RESULTS: Residents from areas with higher park density and high land-use mix were more likely to report active park use while those from areas with high connectivity were less likely. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that objective attributes of the residential BE are associated with perceived active park use. However, our study also points to the importance of surrounding environment, with the result of an inverse relationship between connectivity and physical activity, which highlights the potentially necessary interventions in the realm of traffic and pedestrian safety.},

abstract = {Driven by the demands on healthcare resulting from the shift toward more sedentary lifestyles, considerable effort has been devoted to the monitoring and classification of human activity. In previous studies, various classification schemes and feature extraction methods have been used to identify different activities from a range of different datasets. In this paper, we present a comparison of 14 methods to extract classification features from accelerometer signals. These are based on the wavelet transform and other well-known time- and frequency-domain signal characteristics. To allow an objective comparison between the different features, we used two datasets of activities collected from 20 subjects. The first set comprised three commonly used activities, namely, level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent, and the second a total of eight activities. Furthermore, we compared the classification accuracy for each feature set across different combinations of three different accelerometer placements. The classification analysis has been performed with robust subject-based cross-validation methods using a nearest-neighbor classifier. The findings show that, although the wavelet transform approach can be used to characterize nonstationary signals, it does not perform as accurately as frequency-based features when classifying dynamic activities performed by healthy subjects. Overall, the best feature sets achieved over 95{\%} intersubject classification accuracy.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The expansion and adoption of new methods of communication provide new opportunities for delivering health behavior change interventions. This paper reviews the current research examining mobile telephone short-message service (SMS) for delivering health behavior change interventions via text messages. This service has wide population reach, can be individually tailored, and allows instant delivery with asynchronous receipt, suggesting potential as a delivery channel for health behavior interventions. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: An electronic database search was conducted for studies published between January 1990 and March 2008. Studies were included in the review if they (1) evaluated an intervention delivered primarily via SMS, (2) assessed change in health behavior using pre-post assessment, and (3) were published in English in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 33 studies identified, 14 met the inclusion criteria. Four of the 14 studies reviewed targeted preventive health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation), and ten focused on clinical care (e.g., diabetes self-management). Positive behavior change outcomes were observed in 13 of the 14 reviewed studies. Intervention initiation (researcher or participant), SMS dialogue initiation, tailoring of SMS content, and interactivity were found to be important features of SMS-delivered interventions. Methodologic issues with current SMS research were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that SMS-delivered interventions have positive short-term behavioral outcomes. Further research is required to evaluate interventions for preventive health behaviors that incorporate features found to affect behavioral outcomes and participant acceptance. The quality of studies in this emerging field of research needs to improve to allow the full potential of this medium to be explored.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We estimated the use of preventive dental care services by the US Medicare population, and we assessed whether money spent on preventive dental care resulted in less money being spent on expensive nonpreventive procedures. METHODS: We used data from the 2002 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to estimate a multinomial logistic model to analyze the influence of predisposing, enabling, and need variables in identifying those beneficiaries who used preventive dental care, only nonpreventive dental care, or no dental care in a multiple-variable context. We used regression models with similar controls to estimate the influence of preventive care on the utilization and cost of nonpreventive dental care and all dental care. RESULTS: Our analyses showed that beneficiaries who used preventive dental care had more dental visits but fewer visits for expensive nonpreventive procedures and lower dental expenses than beneficiaries who saw the dentist only for treatment of oral problems. CONCLUSIONS: Adding dental coverage for preventive care to Medicare could pay off in terms of both improving the oral health of the elderly population and limiting the costs of expensive nonpreventive dental care for the dentate beneficiary population.},

This systematic review provides an overview of behavior change interventions for disease management and prevention delivered through text messaging.

Only those interventions using text message as the primary mode of communication were included. Study quality was assessed by using a standardized measure. Seventeen articles representing 12 studies (5 disease prevention and 7 disease management) were included. Intervention length ranged from 3 months to 12 months, none had long-term follow-up, and message frequency varied. Of 9 sufficiently powered studies, 8 found evidence to support text messaging as a tool for behavior change. Effects exist across age, minority status, and nationality. Nine countries are represented in this review, but it is problematic that only one is a developing country, given potential benefits of such a widely accessible, relatively inexpensive tool for health behavior change. Methodological issues and gaps in the literature are highlighted, and recommendations for future studies are provided.},

This technology has the potential to be used in automated activity profiling systems which produce a continuous record of activity patterns over extended periods of time. Such activity profiling systems are dependent on classification algorithms which can effectively interpret body-worn sensor data and identify different activities. This article reviews the different techniques which have been used to classify normal activities and/or identify falls from body-worn sensor data. The review is structured according to the different analytical techniques and illustrates the variety of approaches which have previously been applied in this field. Although significant progress has been made in this important area, there is still significant scope for further work, particularly in the application of advanced classification techniques to problems involving many different activities.},

abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to develop and test two artificial neural networks (ANN) to apply to physical activity data collected with a commonly used uniaxial accelerometer. The first ANN model estimated physical activity metabolic equivalents (METs), and the second ANN identified activity type. Subjects (n = 24 men and 24 women, mean age = 35 yr) completed a menu of activities that included sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous intensities, and each activity was performed for 10 min. There were three different activity menus, and 20 participants completed each menu. Oxygen consumption (in ml x kg(-1) x min(-1)) was measured continuously, and the average of minutes 4-9 was used to represent the oxygen cost of each activity. To calculate METs, activity oxygen consumption was divided by 3.5 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1) (1 MET). Accelerometer data were collected second by second using the Actigraph model 7164. For the analysis, we used the distribution of counts (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of a minute's second-by-second counts) and temporal dynamics of counts (lag, one autocorrelation) as the accelerometer feature inputs to the ANN. To examine model performance, we used the leave-one-out cross-validation technique. The ANN prediction of METs root-mean-squared error was 1.22 METs (confidence interval: 1.14-1.30). For the prediction of activity type, the ANN correctly classified activity type 88.8{\%} of the time (confidence interval: 86.4-91.2{\%}). Activity types were low-level activities, locomotion, vigorous sports, and household activities/other activities. This novel approach of applying ANNs for processing Actigraph accelerometer data is promising and shows that we can successfully estimate activity METs and identify activity type using ANN analytic procedures.},

abstract = {P>The objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based interventions on weight loss and maintenance and identify which components of web-based interventions are associated with greater weight change and low attrition rates. A literature search from 1995 to April 2008 was conducted. Studies were eligible for inclusion if: participants were aged >= 18 years with a body mass index >= 25, at least one study arm involved a web-based intervention with the primary aim of weight loss or maintenance, and reported weight-related outcomes. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies aimed to achieve weight loss, and five focused on weight maintenance. Heterogeneity was evident among the studies with seven research questions examined across interventions of varying intensity. Seven studies were assessed for effectiveness based on percentage weight change, with four studies deemed effective. Although the four meta-analyses suggest meaningful weight change, it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of web-based interventions in achieving weight loss or maintenance due to heterogeneity of designs and thus the small number of comparable studies. Higher usage of website features may be associated with positive weight change, but we do not know what features improve this effect or reduce attrition.},

abstract = {Tailoring individualizes information to the receiver and provides a potential strategy for improving dietary intakes. The present systematic review summarizes evidence for the long-term (>= 6 months) effectiveness of tailored nutrition education for adults and includes priority population groups. Key electronic databases and relevant bibliographies were searched for trials measuring the following outcomes: nutrition-related health behaviors (e.g., dietary intake and food purchases) and anthropometric measures. Data synthesis was comprised of meta-analysis (for 15 trials including all population groups) and narrative review (for five trials of priority population groups). Overall, the quality of the studies was moderate to good. Tailored nutrition education was found to be a promising strategy for improving the diets of adults (including those in priority population groups) over the long term. However, future studies should ensure adequate reporting of research design and methods and reduce the chances of false-positive findings by using more objective measures of diet, clearly identifying the primary study outcome, and concentrating on outcomes most relevant to nutrition-related disease.},

abstract = {The Internet has the potential for delivering innovative, interactive physical activity (PA) interventions to large numbers of people. This study was designed to test the efficacy of an Internet intervention that consisted of a Web site plus 12 weekly e-mail tip sheets, compared with a waiting list control group. The Internet intervention was theory based and emphasized clear, graphical presentation of PA information. Sixty-five (30 intervention and 35 control) sedentary adult employees of several large hospitals (9 men and 56 women) were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 study arms. Of the 65 participants, 57 completed the 1-month follow-up, and 52 completed the 3-month follow-up. At both 1 and 3 months, those in the intervention group were significantly more likely to have progressed in stage of motivational readiness for PA than participants in the control group: 1 month, c2(1, N =52) =4.05, p <.05; 3 months, c2(1, N =52) =6.45, p <.01. We hypothesized that at 1 and 3 months, the intervention group would exhibit significant increases relative to the control group on the number of minutes of moderate activity. At the 1-month assessment, the intervention group did exhibit significant increases, relative to the control group in moderate minutes, F(1, 54) =5.79, p <.05; however, at the 3-month assessment this difference was no longer significant. In addition, secondary analyses were conducted to examine total number of minutes of walking reported. At 1 month, the intervention group did exhibit significant increases, relative to the control group, in walking minutes, F(1, 54) =12.1, p <.001. At the 3-month assessment, amount of time spent in walking activity continued to be significantly higher for the intervention group compared with the control group, F(1, 48) =5.2, p <.05. These findings show that a theoretically based PA Web site and weekly e-mail tip sheets can have a short-term impact on PA motivation and behavior both at 1 and 3 months. As Internet access increases, and as bandwidth and other technical attributes of this medium improve, Web site delivered health behavior interventions will become increasingly useful in public health promotion.},

abstract = {Aim It is estimated that more than 180 million people worldwide have diabetes. Health-care providers can remotely deliver health services to this patient population using information and communication technology, also known as home telehealth. Home telehealth may be classified into two subtypes: home telemonitoring (HTM) and telephone support (TS). The research objective was to systematically review the literature and perform meta-analyses to assess the potential benefits of home telehealth compared with usual care (UC) for patients with diabetes. Methods An electronic literature search was conducted to identify studies on home telehealth and patients with diabetes that were published between 1998 and 2008 using Medline, Medline In-Process {\&} Other Non-Indexed Citations, BIOSIS Previews and EMBASE. Results Twenty-six studies (n = 5069 patients) on home telehealth for diabetes were selected. Twenty-one studies evaluated HTM and 5 randomized controlled trials assessed TS. HTM had a positive effect on glycaemic control [as measured by lower glycated haemoglobin level] compared with UC (weighted mean difference = -0.21; 95{\%} confidence interval -0.35 to -0.08), but the results were mixed for TS. Study results indicated that home telehealth helps to reduce the number of patients hospitalized, hospitalizations and bed days of care. Home telehealth was similar or favourable to UC across studies for quality-of-life and patient satisfaction outcomes. Conclusions In general, home telehealth had a positive impact on the use of numerous health services and glycaemic control. More studies of higher methodological quality are required to give more precise insights into the potential clinical effectiveness of home telehealth interventions.},

abstract = {The burgeoning of consumer health informatics and virtual health care can help people improve their health. However, little is known about individuals' reactions to such systems. We conducted an evaluation of the telephone-linked care (TLC) system, a computer-based telecommunications system, that functions as an at home monitor, educator, and counselor for patients with chronic health conditions. Our multimethod assessment of individuals' reactions to using TLC included both quantitative and qualitative methods. Ethnographic in-depth open-ended interviews indicated more subtle and surprising reactions to TLC than the overall positive responses from surveys: individuals formed personal relationships with this technology. This relationship formation suggests that TLC designers may have been successful in their attempts to emulate a conversation with a human being. Our study adds to evidence that technology can serve as a projective device for peoples' values and psychological issues. Both designers and users project values and goals onto computer-based technologies and take on different identities through it. Different groups of users, therefore, may see the same technology differently. People also form relationships with technologies, as they did with TLC. These findings, as well as implications for system design and health outcomes, need to be explored in additional studies. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The efficacy of Internet interventions has been demonstrated across a wide range of conditions. Much more work remains, however, to enhance the potential for broad population dissemination of Internet interventions. In this article, we examine the effectiveness of Internet interventions, with particular attention to their dissemination potential. We discuss several considerations (characterizing reach rates, minimizing attrition, promoting Web site utilization, use of tailored messaging and social networking) that may improve the implementation of Internet interventions and their associated outcomes. We review factors that may influence the adoption of Internet interventions in a range of potential dissemination settings. Finally, we present several recommendations for future research that highlight the potential importance of better understanding intervention reach, developing consensus regarding Web site usage metrics, and more broadly integrating Web 2.0 functionality.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to review the evidence about what factors influence user engagement in Internet-based behavioral interventions for chronic illness. We conducted a systematic review of the recent published literature. Searches of MEDLINE (using Ovid and PubMed), The Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, from January 2000 to December 2008, were completed. Additional articles were identified from searching the bibliographies of retrieved articles. We identified studies of interactive health communication interventions delivered via the Internet that, apart from delivering health information, had another component such as interactive tools to manage illness, decision support for treatment, or social support. We restricted the age range to adulthood. The search identified 186 abstracts; 46 articles were reviewed. We used a qualitative approach called "positive deviance'' to study those interventions that have succeeded in engaging users where most have failed. Some ways to improve user engagement in Internet interventions suggested by our review include addressing health concerns that are important and relevant to an individual patient or consumer and an individualized approach, such as personally tailored advice and feedback. Interventions that are part of larger health management programs that include clinicians appear to be especially promising.},

abstract = {Objective: Obesity is highly prevalent among American adults and has negative health and psychosocial consequences. The purpose of this article was to qualitatively review studies that used technology-based interventions for weight loss and to identify specific components of these interventions that are effective in facilitating weight loss. Materials and Methods: We conducted a narrow, qualitative review, focusing on articles published in the last 10 years that used an experimental or pre/posttest design and used a technology-based intervention for weight loss. Results: Among the 21 studies reviewed, we identified the following five components that we consider to be crucial in technology-based weight-loss interventions that are successful in facilitating weight loss: self monitoring, counselor feedback and communication, social support, use of a structured program, and use of an individually tailored program. Conclusions: Short-term results of technologically driven weight-loss interventions using these components have been promising, but long-term results have been mixed. Although more longitudinal studies are needed for interventions implementing these five components, the interface of technology and behavior change is an effective foundation of a successful, short-term weight-loss program and may prove to be the basis of long-term weight loss.},

abstract = {Objective: To review eHealth intervention studies for adults and children that targeted behavior change for physical activity, healthy eating, or both behaviors. Data Sources: Systematic literature searches were performed using five databases: MEDLINE, PsychInfo, CINAHL, ERIC, and the Cochrane Library to retrieve articles. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Articles published in scientific journals were included if they evaluated an intervention for physical activity and/or dietary behaviors, or focused on weight loss, used randomized or quasi-experimental designs, measured outcomes at baseline and a follow-up period, and included an intervention where participants interacted with some type of electronic technology either as the main intervention or an adjunct component. All studies were published between 2000 and 2005. Results: Eighty-six publications were initially identified, of which 49 met the inclusion criteria (13 physical activity publications, 16 dietary behaviors publications, and 20 weight loss or both physical activity and diet publications), and represented 47 different studies. Studies were described on multiple dimensions, including sample characteristics, design, intervention, measures, and results. eHealth interventions were superior to comparison groups for 21 of 41 (51{\%}) studies (3 physical activity, 7 diet, 11 weight loss/physical activity and diet). Twenty-four studies had indeterminate results, and in four studies the comparison conditions outperformed eHealth interventions. Conclusions: Published studies of eHealth interventions for physical activity and dietary behavior change are in their infancy. Results indicated mixed findings related to the effectiveness of eHealth interventions. Interventions that feature interactive technologies need to be refined and more rigorously evaluated to fully determine their potential as tools to facilitate health behavior change.},

abstract = {Background: inactive people are often not aware of the fact that they are insufficiently active. Providing insight into their actual physical activity (PA) levels may raise awareness and could, in combination with tailored PA advice, stimulate a physically active lifestyle. Objective: This study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a 3-month intervention in which Dutch office workers were provided with a personal activity monitor (PAM) coupled to simple and concise Web-based tailored PA advice (PAM COACH). Method: Participants were randomly assigned to the 3-month PAM intervention (n = 51) or received a single written information brochure with brief general PA recommendations (n = 5 1). Study outcome measures were changes in PA (recall of minutes per week spent on PA, as measured by the Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults), determinants of PA, aerobic fitness, and body composition. Follow-up measurements were performed immediately after the 3-month intervention and at 8-months, 5 months after the end of the 3-month intervention period. Results: A total of 102 workers, 23 to 39 years old, completed the baseline measurement at the worksite. 48 completed the 3-month follow up and 38 the 8-month follow-up in the intervention group, 50 completed the 3-month follow up and 42 the 8-month follow up in the control group. 35 out of 48 (73{\%}) participants in the PAM intervention group reported wearing the PAM regularly, and the PAM COACH was used almost once a week; 24 out of 46 (52{\%}) PAM users set a personal goal, and 33 (72{\%}) entered their favorite activities on the website. Main reasons for not using these items were lack of interest or not being able to find the item on the website. The majority of PAM users (34 out of 46, 74{\%}) read the advice, of whom 14 (39{\%}) found it unappealing. After the 3-month intervention, no significant intervention effect was observed (adjusted difference in min/week) for sedentary behavior (beta = 10, 95{\%} CI = -435 to 455), light-intensity PA (beta = -129, 95{\%} CI = -337 to 79), moderate-intensity PA (beta = -13. 95{\%} CI = -89 to 63), vigorous-intensity PA (beta = -6, 95{\%} CI= -75 to 62), and moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (beta = -23, 95{\%} CI = -121 to 76). No significant intervention effect was observed in the PA outcomes at the 8-month follow-up. For the determinants of PA, aerobic fitness, and body composition, no statistically significant intervention effect was observed in the total study population immediately after the 3-month intervention or the 8-month follow-up. Conclusions: The intervention appeared to be easily applicable to real-life settings. The intervention was ineffective in improving PA behavior or its determinants in healthy office workers. More attention should have been given to the quality and appropriateness of the tailored advice.},

abstract = {Optimal diabetes management involves considerable behavioural modification, while nonadherence contributes significantly to poor glycaemia. Extensive research on psychological interventions aiming to improve glycaemia suggests that current strategies are costly and time-consuming and in our experience do not appeal to young people with Type 1 diabetes. Text messaging has rapidly become a socially popular form of communication. It is personal, highly transportable, and widely used, particularly in the adolescent population. However, text messaging coupled with specific behavioural health strategies has yet to be utilised effectively. We have developed a novel support network ("Sweet Talk"), based on a unique text-messaging system designed to deliver individually targeted messages and general diabetes information. Individualised motivation strategies--based on social cognition theory, the health belief model, and goal setting--form the theoretical basis of the message content. Intensifying insulin therapy and increasing contact with the diabetes team can improve control, but are difficult to provide within existing resources. Our support system offers a means of contact and support between clinic visits and aims to increase adherence with intensive insulin regimens and to improve clinical outcome.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The expansion and adoption of new methods of communication provide new opportunities for delivering health behavior change interventions. This paper reviews the current research examining mobile telephone short-message service (SMS) for delivering health behavior change interventions via text messages. This service has wide population reach, can be individually tailored, and allows instant delivery with asynchronous receipt, suggesting potential as a delivery channel for health behavior interventions. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: An electronic database search was conducted for studies published between January 1990 and March 2008. Studies were included in the review if they (1) evaluated an intervention delivered primarily via SMS, (2) assessed change in health behavior using pre-post assessment, and (3) were published in English in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 33 studies identified, 14 met the inclusion criteria. Four of the 14 studies reviewed targeted preventive health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation), and ten focused on clinical care (e.g., diabetes self-management). Positive behavior change outcomes were observed in 13 of the 14 reviewed studies. Intervention initiation (researcher or participant), SMS dialogue initiation, tailoring of SMS content, and interactivity were found to be important features of SMS-delivered interventions. Methodologic issues with current SMS research were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that SMS-delivered interventions have positive short-term behavioral outcomes. Further research is required to evaluate interventions for preventive health behaviors that incorporate features found to affect behavioral outcomes and participant acceptance. The quality of studies in this emerging field of research needs to improve to allow the full potential of this medium to be explored.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effectiveness of an educational intervention that used both the cellular phone with a short messaging service (SMS) and the Internet on the glycemic control of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group and twenty-six to a control group. The intervention was applied for 12 months. The goal of the intervention was to keep blood glucose concentrations close to the normal range (HbA(1)c<7{\%}). Patients in the intervention group were asked to access a website by using a cellular phone or to wiring the Internet and input their blood glucose levels weekly. Participants were sent the optimal recommendations by both cellular phone and the Internet weekly. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group had lower HbA(1)c over 12 months when compared with the control group. At 12 months the change from baseline in HbA(1)c was -1.32 in the intervention group versus +0.81 in the control group. Two hours post-meal glucose (2HPMG) had a significantly greater decline in the intervention group after 12 months when compared with the control group (-100.0 versus +18.1mg/dl). CONCLUSION: This educational intervention using the Internet and a SMS by cellular phone rapidly improved and stably maintained the glycemic control of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {Since the last comprehensive review in 1974, the Health Belief Model (HBM) has continued to be the focus of considerable theoretical and research attention. This article presents a critical review of 29 HBM-related investigations published during the period 1974-1984, tabulates the findings from 17 studies conducted prior to 1974, and provides a summary of the total 46 HBM studies (18 prospective, 28 retrospective). Twenty-four studies examined preventive-health be haviors (PHB), 19 explored sick-role behaviors (SRB), and three addressed clinic utilization. A "significance ratio" was constructed which divides the number of positive, statistically- significant findings for an HBM dimension by the total number of studies reporting significance levels for that dimension. Summary results provide substantial empirical support for the HBM, with findings from prospective studies at least as favorable as those obtained from retrospective research. "Perceived barriers" proved to be the most powerful of the HBM dimensions across the various study designs and behaviors. While both were important overall, "perceived sus ceptibility" was a stronger contributor to understanding PHB than SRB, while the reverse was true for "perceived benefits." "Perceived severity" produced the lowest overall significance ratios; however, while only weakly associated with PHB, this dimension was strongly related to SRB. On the basis of the evidence compiled, it is recommended that consideration of HBM dimensions be a part of health education programming. Suggestions are offered for further research.},

abstract = {Accurate determination of speed is important in many studies of human and animal locomotion. Some global positioning system (GPS) receivers can data log instantaneous speed. The speed accuracy of these systems is, however, unclear with manufacturers reporting velocity accuracies of 0.1-0.2 ms(-1). This study set out to trial non-differential GPS as a means of determining speed under real-life conditions. A bicycle was ridden around a running track and a custom-made bicycle speedometer was calibrated. Additional experiments were performed around circular tracks of known circumference and along a straight road. Instantaneous speed was determined simultaneously by the custom speedometer and a data logging helmet-mounted GPS receiver. GPS speed was compared to speedometer speed. The effect on speed accuracy of satellite number; changing satellite geometry, achieved through shielding the GPS antenna; speed; horizontal dilution of precision and cyclist position on a straight or a bend, was evaluated. The relative contribution of each variable to overall speed accuracy was determined by ANOVA. The speed determined by the GPS receiver was within 0.2 ms(-1) of the true speed measured for 45{\%} of the values with a further 19{\%} lying within 0.4 ms(-1) (n = 5060). The accuracy of speed determination was preserved even when the positional data were degraded due to poor satellite number or geometry. GPS data loggers are therefore accurate for the determination of speed over-ground in biomechanical and energetic studies performed on relatively straight courses. Errors increase on circular paths, especially those with small radii of curvature, due to a tendency to underestimate speed.},

abstract = {Background: To motivate individuals to adhere to a regular physical activity regime, guidelines must be supplemented with persuasive messages that are disseminated widely. While substantial research has examined effective strategies for disseminating physical activity messages, there has been no systematic effort to examine optimal message content. This paper reviews studies that evaluate the effectiveness of three approaches for constructing physical activity messages including tailoring messages to suit individual characteristics of message recipients (message tailoring), framing messages in terms of gains versus losses (message framing), and targeting messages to affect change in self-efficacy (i.e., a theoretical determinant of behavior change). Methods: We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE and CINAHL databases up to July 2008. Relevant reference lists also were searched. We included intervention trials, field experiments, and laboratory-based studies that aimed to test the efficacy or effectiveness of tailored messages, framed messages and self-efficacy change messages among healthy adults. We used a descriptive approach to analyze emerging patterns in research findings. Based on this evidence we made recommendations for practice and future research. Results: Twenty-two studies were identified. Twelve studies evaluated message tailoring. In 10 of these studies, tailored messages resulted in greater physical activity than a control message. Six studies evaluated framed messages. Five of these studies demonstrated that gain-framed messages lead to stronger intentions to be active compared to a control message. Moreover, a gain-frame advantage was evident in three of the four studies that assessed physical activity. Four studies evaluated self-efficacy change messages. The two studies that used an experimental design provide a clear indication that individuals' beliefs can be affected by messages that incorporate types of information known to be determinants of self-efficacy. Overall, strong evidence to support definitive recommendations for optimal message content and structure was lacking. Conclusions: Additional research testing the optimal content of messages used to supplement physical activity guidelines is needed. Tailored messages, gain-framed messages, and self-efficacy change messages hold promise as strategies for constructing physical activity messages and should be a focus of future research.},

abstract = {Objective. Many patients do not receive guideline-recommended care for diabetes and other chronic conditions. Automated speech-recognition telephone outreach to supplement in-person physician-patient communication may enhance patient care for chronic illness. We conducted this study to inform the development of an automated telephone outreach intervention for improving diabetes care among members of a large, not-for-profit health plan. Design. In-depth telephone interviews with qualitative analysis. Setting/participants. Individuals with diabetes (n = 36) enrolled in a large regional health plan in the USA. Main outcome measures. Patients' opinions about automated speech-recognition telephone technology. Results. Patients who were recently diagnosed with diabetes and some with diabetes for a decade or more expressed basic informational needs. While most would prefer to speak with a live person rather than a computer-recorded voice, many felt that the automated system could successfully supplement the information they receive from their physicians and could serve as an integral part of their care. Patients suggested that such a system could provide specific dietary advice, information about diabetes and its self-care, a call-in menu of information topics, reminders about laboratory test results and appointments, tracking of personal laboratory results and feedback about their self-monitoring. Conclusions. While some patients expressed negative attitudes toward automated speech recognition telephone systems generally, most felt that a variety of functions of such a system could be beneficial to their diabetes care. In-depth interviews resulted in substantive input from health plan members for the design of an automated telephone outreach system to supplement in-person physician-patient communication in this population.},

@article{Norman2007a,
abstract = {Objective: To review eHealth intervention studies for adults and children that targeted behavior change for physical activity, healthy eating, or both behaviors. Data Sources: Systematic literature searches were performed using five databases: MEDLINE, PsychInfo, CINAHL, ERIC, and the Cochrane Library to retrieve articles. Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Articles published in scientific journals were included if they evaluated an intervention for physical activity and/or dietary behaviors, or focused on weight loss, used randomized or quasi-experimental designs, measured outcomes at baseline and a follow-up period, and included an intervention where participants interacted with some type of electronic technology either as the main intervention or an adjunct component. All studies were published between 2000 and 2005. Results: Eighty-six publications were initially identified, of which 49 met the inclusion criteria (13 physical activity publications, 16 dietary behaviors publications, and 20 weight loss or both physical activity and diet publications), and represented 47 different studies. Studies were described on multiple dimensions, including sample characteristics, design, intervention, measures, and results. eHealth interventions were superior to comparison groups for 21 of 41 (51{\%}) studies (3 physical activity, 7 diet, 11 weight loss/physical activity and diet). Twenty-four studies had indeterminate results, and in four studies the comparison conditions outperformed eHealth interventions. Conclusions: Published studies of eHealth interventions for physical activity and dietary behavior change are in their infancy. Results indicated mixed findings related to the effectiveness of eHealth interventions. Interventions that feature interactive technologies need to be refined and more rigorously evaluated to fully determine their potential as tools to facilitate health behavior change.},

abstract = {The primary objectives of the present study were to gain insight into website use and to predict the surfing depth on a behaviour change website and its effect on behaviour. Two hundred eight highly educated adults from the intervention condition of a randomised trial received access to a medical intervention, individual coaching (by e-mail, post, telephone or face-to-face) and a behaviour change website. Website use (e.g. surfing depth, page view duration) was registered. Online questionnaires for physical activity and fat intake were filled out at baseline and after 6 months. Hierarchical linear regression was used to predict surfing depth and its effect on behaviour. Seventy-five per cent of the participants visited the website. Fifty-one and fifty-six per cent consulted the physical activity and fat intake feedback, respectively. The median surfing depth was 2. The total duration of interventions by e-mail predicted deeper surfing (beta = 0.36; p < 0.001). Surfing depth did not predict changes in fat intake (beta = -0.07; p = 0.45) or physical activity (beta = -0.03; p = 0.72). Consulting the physical activity feedback led to more physical activity (beta = 0.23; p = 0.01). The findings from the present study can be used to guide future website development and improve the information architecture of behaviour change websites.},

abstract = {Intervention efficacy can be increased when the treatment is maximally matched to the needs of the client. One means of achieving such matching is through use of an expert system, a computer-based decision-making system designed to utilize client information to produce unique, matched information and interventions. An expert system can combine the individual matching possible in a clinic-based intervention and the low cost associated with a public health approach. This paper begins by discussing several alternative implementations of the expert system approach within the general context of communication theory. Second, the theoretical model and related empirical evidence which form the basis of the expert system is described briefly. Third, the details of a computer-driven, expert system intervention specifically developed for smoking cessation is described. Finally, empirical results from a study comparing the expert system intervention to three alternative interventions for smoking cessation are presented. In general, the expert system approach can provide a cost effective, viable, and efficacious means of intervening in a specific problem behavior area. Implications and potential areas of development are discussed.},

Automated speech-recognition telephone outreach to supplement in-person physician-patient communication may enhance patient care for chronic illness. We conducted this study to inform the development of an automated telephone outreach intervention for improving diabetes care among members of a large, not-for-profit health plan. Design. In-depth telephone interviews with qualitative analysis. Setting/participants. Individuals with diabetes (n = 36) enrolled in a large regional health plan in the USA. Main outcome measures. Patients' opinions about automated speech-recognition telephone technology. Results. Patients who were recently diagnosed with diabetes and some with diabetes for a decade or more expressed basic informational needs. While most would prefer to speak with a live person rather than a computer-recorded voice, many felt that the automated system could successfully supplement the information they receive from their physicians and could serve as an integral part of their care. Patients suggested that such a system could provide specific dietary advice, information about diabetes and its self-care, a call-in menu of information topics, reminders about laboratory test results and appointments, tracking of personal laboratory results and feedback about their self-monitoring. Conclusions. While some patients expressed negative attitudes toward automated speech recognition telephone systems generally, most felt that a variety of functions of such a system could be beneficial to their diabetes care. In-depth interviews resulted in substantive input from health plan members for the design of an automated telephone outreach system to supplement in-person physician-patient communication in this population.},

abstract = {The Internet is a relatively new method of delivering strategies for health behavior change. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of delivering a physical activity intervention by the Internet to improve outcomes in adults with the metabolic syndrome. Twenty-two participants (16 males; 6 females) were recruited from a cardiology clinic database, age range 32-66 years. Participants were randomly assigned to the Internet intervention (n = 12) or the usual care (n = 10) group. The mean total dose, in terms of the time the intervention Web site was accessed was 2 hours over 6 weeks, which was greater than the time spent delivering usual care. Overall, participants' evaluations of the Internet intervention were positive. The costs of development and delivery of the Internet intervention were less than that of a consultation and follow-up in the cardiology clinic for this sample. The Internet intervention appears feasible for testing in a larger study.},

Purpose: The aim was to assess nutrition; physical activity; and, secondarily, body weight in the tailored, social cognitive Guide to Health (GTH) Internet intervention delivered in churches. Methods: Participants (N = 1,071; 33{\%} male, 23{\%} African American, 57{\%} with body mass index >=25, 60{\%} sedentary, Mdn age = 53 years) within 14 Baptist or United Methodist churches were randomized to the GTH intervention only (GTH-Only; 5 churches), with church-based supports (GTH-Plus; 5 churches), or to a waitlist (control; 4 churches). Verified pedometer step counts, measured body weight, fat, fiber, and fruit and vegetable (F{\&}V) servings from food frequency and supermarket receipts were collected at pretest, posttest (7 months after pretest), and follow-up (16 months after pretest). Results: Participants in GTH-Only increased F{\&}V at post ({\~{}} 1.50 servings) compared to control ({\~{}} 0.50 servings; p = .005) and at follow-up ({\~{}} 1.20 vs. {\~{}} 0.50 servings; p = .038) and increased fiber at post ({\~{}} 3.00 g) compared to control ({\~{}} 1.5 g; p = .006) and follow-up ({\~{}} 3.00 g vs. {\~{}} 2.00 g; p = .040). GTH-Plus participants compared to control increased steps at post ({\~{}} 1,500 steps/day vs. {\~{}} 400 steps/day; p = .050) and follow-up ({\~{}} 1,000 steps/day vs. {\~{}} 50 steps/day; p = .010), increased F{\&}V at post ({\~{}} 1.5 servings; p = .007) and follow-up ({\~{}} 1.3 servings; p = .014), increased fiber at post ({\~{}} 3.00A g; p = .013), and follow-up ({\~{}} 3.00; p = .050) and decreased weight at post ({\~{}} -0.30 kg vs. {\~{}} +0.60 kg; p = .030). Conclusions: Compared to control, both GTH treatments improved nutrition at posttest, but church supports improved physical activity and nutrition at posttest and follow-up, suggesting environmental supports may improve Internet-based interventions.

abstract = {Assessing the total energy expenditure (TEE) and the levels of physical activity in free-living conditions with non-invasive techniques remains a challenge. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the accuracy of a new uniaxial accelerometer for assessing TEE and physical-activity-related energy expenditure (PAEE) over a 24 h period in a respiratory chamber, and to establish activity levels based on the accelerometry ranges corresponding to the operationally defined metabolic equivalent (MET) categories. In study 1, measurement of the 24 h energy expenditure of seventy-nine Japanese subjects (40 (SD 12) years old) was performed in a large respiratory chamber. During the measurements, the subjects wore a uniaxial accelerometer (Lifecorder; Suzuken Co. Ltd, Nagoya, Japan) on their belt. Two moderate walking exercises of 30 min each were performed on a horizontal treadmill. In study 2, ten male subjects walked at six different speeds and ran at three different speeds on a treadmill for 4 min, with the same accelerometer. O2 consumption was measured during the last minute of each stage and was expressed in MET. The measured TEE was 8447 (SD 1337) kJ/d. The accelerometer significantly underestimated TEE and PAEE (91.9 (SD 5.4) and 92.7 (SD 17.8) {\%} chamber value respectively); however, there was a significant correlation between the two values (r 0.928 and 0.564 respectively; P<0.001). There was a strong correlation between the activity levels and the measured MET while walking (r(2) 0.93; P<0.001). Although TEE and PAEE were systematically underestimated during the 24 h period, the accelerometer assessed energy expenditure well during both the exercise period and the non-structured activities. Individual calibration factors may help to improve the accuracy of TEE estimation, but the average calibration factor for the group is probably sufficient for epidemiological research. This method is also important for assessing the diurnal profile of physical activity.},

abstract = {Aims This paper reviews a set of theories of behaviour change that are used outside the field of addiction and considers their relevance for this field. Methods Ten theories are reviewed in terms of (i) the main tenets of each theory, (ii) the implications of the theory for promoting change in addictive behaviours and (iii) studies in the field of addiction that have used the theory. An augmented feedback loop model based on Control Theory is used to organize the theories and to show how different interventions might achieve behaviour change. Results Briefly, each theory provided the following recommendations for intervention: Control Theory: prompt behavioural monitoring, Goal-Setting Theory: set specific and challenging goals, Model of Action Phases: form 'implementation intentions', Strength Model of Self-Control: bolster self-control resources, Social Cognition Models (Protection Motivation Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Health Belief Model): modify relevant cognitions, Elaboration Likelihood Model: consider targets' motivation and ability to process information, Prototype Willingness Model: change perceptions of the prototypical person who engages in behaviour and Social Cognitive Theory: modify self-efficacy. Conclusions There are a range of theories in the field of behaviour change that can be applied usefully to addiction, each one pointing to a different set of modifiable determinants and/or behaviour change techniques. Studies reporting interventions should describe theoretical basis, behaviour change techniques and mode of delivery accurately so that effective interventions can be understood and replicated.},

abstract = {A placement effect on activity measures from movement sensors has been reported during treadmill and free-living activity. Positioning of electrodes may impact on movement artifact susceptibility as well as surface ECG waveform amplitudes and thus potentially on the precision by which heart rate (HR) is ascertained from such ECG traces. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which placement of the combined HR and movement sensor, Actiheart, influences measurement of HR and movement, and estimates of energy expenditure. A total of 24 participants (20-39 years, 45-109 kg, 1.54-2.05 m, 19-29 kg m(-2)) were recruited. Whilst wearing two monitors, one placed at the level of the third intercostal space (upper position) and one just below the apex of the sternum (lower position), study participants performed level walking, incline walking, and level running on treadmill, and completed at least one day of free-living monitoring. Placement differences in HR data quality, movement counts, and energy expenditure (estimated from combined HR and movement) were analyzed with regression techniques. Quality of HR data was generally higher when monitors were placed in the lower position. This effect was more pronounced in men during both treadmill activity (relative risk, RR [95{\%} CI] of noisy HR data in upper vs. lower position, RR=1.3[0.3; 5.6] in women, RR=174[14; 2,156] in men) and during free-living (RR=1.2[0.4; 3.3] in women, RR=25[9.6; 67] in men). There were minor placement differences (< or =8{\%}) in movement counts only in women during incline walking and running. During free-living, no placement effect on counts was observed. In all test scenarios, estimates of energy expenditure from the two positions were not significantly different. Positioning the Actiheart at the level below the sternum may yield cleaner HR data. Regardless of which position is used, this has little or no effect on movement counts and energy expenditure estimates, which is encouraging for studies where research participants may have to position the monitors themselves.},

abstract = {Background: Drawing on previous web-based diabetes management programs based on the Chronic Care Model, we expanded an intervention to include care management through mobile phones and a game console web browser. Methods: The pilot intervention enrolled eight diabetes patients from the University of Washington in Seattle into a collaborative care program: connecting them to a care provider specializing in diabetes, providing access to their full electronic medical record, allowing wireless glucose uploads and e-mail with providers, and connecting them to the program's web services through a game system. To evaluate the study, we conducted qualitative thematic analysis of semistructured interviews. Results: Participants expressed frustrations with using the cell phones and the game system in their everyday lives, but liked the wireless system for collaborating with a provider on uploaded glucoses and receiving automatic feedback on their blood sugar trends. A majority of participants also expressed that their participation in the trial increased their health awareness. Discussion: Mobile communication technologies showed promise within a web-based collaborative care program for type 2 diabetes. Future intervention design should focus on integrating easy-to-use applications within mobile technologies already familiar to patients and ensure the system allows for sufficient collaboration with a care provider.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study assessed the effect of a 1-year internet-based weight loss intervention for men. METHODS: Four hundred forty-one overweight and obese men were randomized to intervention or delayed treatment. Participants completed a Web-based assessment of diet and physical activity behaviors and weekly tailored Web modules addressing weight-related behaviors. RESULTS: At 12 months compared to controls, intervention men decreased percent of energy from saturated fat and increased grams of fiber and fruit/vegetable servings per 1.000 kcal (p values < 0.001) and walked 16 min more per day (p < 0.05). No between-group differences in body mass index (BMI), weight, or waist circumference were seen, but among completers, men in the highest tertile of intervention participation had lower weight (98.74 vs. 102.37 kg), BMI (32.38 vs. 33.46), and waist circumference (42.17 vs. 43.47 cm) compared to men who participated less often. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention improved diet and activity behaviors, but weight loss occurred only for those with the highest adherence.},

It deals with the prominent roles played by cognitive, vicarious, self-reflective, and self-regulatory processes in psychosocial functioning. The book is organized to emphasize the reciprocal causation through the interplay of cognitive, behavioral, and environmental factors. Albert Bandura systematically applies this social cognitive theory to personal and social change.  Among its highlights, the book: covers a wide range of issues relating to human thought, motivation, and behavior; provides a theory of social diffusion and innovation that integrates modeling and social-network influences; shows how converging technological changes are transforming the nature and scope of human influence; [and] analyzes the determinants and processes governing personal and social change.  Because of its relevance it [the book] will be of interest to readers in many different disciplines including psychology, education, sociology, communications, political science, business, and law. },

abstract = {The use of smartphones and their associated applications (apps) provides new opportunities for physicians, and specifically orthopaedic surgeons, to integrate technology into clinical practice. The purpose of this study was twofold: to review all apps specifically created for orthopaedic surgeons and to survey orthopaedic residents and surgeons in the United States to characterize the need for novel apps. The five most popular smartphone app stores were searched for orthopaedic-related apps: Blackberry, iPhone, Android, Palm, and Windows. An Internet survey was sent to ACGME-accredited orthopaedic surgery departments to assess the level of smartphone use, app use, and desire for orthopaedic-related apps. The database search revealed that iPhone and Android platforms had apps specifically created for orthopaedic surgery with a total of 61 and 13 apps, respectively. Among the apps reviewed, only one had greater than 100 reviews (mean, 27), and the majority of apps had very few reviews, including AAOS Now and AO Surgery Reference, apps published by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and AO Foundation, respectively. The national survey revealed that 84{\%} of respondents (n = 476) have a smartphone, the majority (55{\%}) have an iPhone, and that 53{\%} of people with smartphones already use apps in clinical practice. Ninety-six percent of respondents who use apps reported they would like more orthopaedic apps and would pay an average of nearly {\$}30 for useful apps. The four most requested categories of apps were textbook/reference, techniques/guides, OITE/board review, and billing/coding. The use of smartphones and apps is prevalent among orthopaedic care providers in academic centers. However, few highly ranked apps specifically related to orthopaedic surgery are available, and the types of apps available do not appear to be the categories most desired by residents and surgeons.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine whether the Nintendo Wii Fit program could be used for fall risk assessment in healthy, community-dwelling older adults. Forty-five community-dwelling older women participated in this study. The "Basic Step" and "Ski Slalom" modules were selected from the Wii Fit game program. The following 5 physical performance tests were performed: the 10-m walk test under single- and dual-task conditions, the Timed Up and Go test under single- and dual-task conditions, and the Functional Reach test. Compared with the faller group, the nonfaller group showed a significant difference in the Basic Step (P < .001) and a nonsignificant difference in the Ski Slalom (P = .453). The discriminating criterion between the 2 groups was a score of 111 points on the Basic Step (P < .001). The Basic Step showed statistically significant, moderate correlations between the dual-task lag of walking (r = .547) and the dual-task lag of the Timed Up and Go test (r = -.688). These results suggest that game-based fall risk assessment using the Basic Step has a high generality and is useful in community-dwelling older adults. (Geriatr Nurs 2011;32:188-194)},

abstract = {This study compared the efficacy of two low-cost interventions for physical activity adoption. Sedentary (N = 194) adults recruited through newspaper advertisements were randomized to receive either a motivationally-matched, individually-tailored intervention (IT) or a standard self-help intervention (ST). Assessments and interventions were delivered by repeated mailings at baseline, one, three, and six months. Participants were assessed regarding current physical activity behavior, motivational readiness to adopt regular physical activity, and psychological constructs associated with physical activity participation (e.g. self-efficacy, decisional balance). Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed significant increases in physical activity participation between baseline and six months for both groups with a significantly greater increase among IT participants. The IT group outperformed the ST group on all primary outcome measures: (a) minutes of physical activity per week, (b) reaching Centers for Disease Control and American College of Sports Medicine (CDC/ACSM) recommended minimum physical activity criteria, and (c) achieving the Action stage of motivational readiness for physical activity adoption. Both groups showed significant improvement between baseline and six months on the psychological constructs associated with physical activity adoption (e.g. self-efficacy), with no significant differences observed between the treatment groups. Utilizing computer expert systems and self-help manuals to provide individually-tailored, motivationally-matched interventions appears to be an effective, low-cost approach for enhancing physical activity participation in the community.},

@article{LBender2011,
abstract = {Background: Social network sites have been growing in popularity across broad segments of Internet users, and are a convenient means to exchange information and support. Research on their use for health-related purposes is limited. Objective: This study aimed to characterize the purpose, use, and creators of Facebook groups related to breast cancer. Methods: We searched Facebook (www.Facebook.com) using the term breast cancer. We restricted our analysis to groups that were related to breast cancer, operated in English, and were publicly available. Two of us independently extracted information on the administrator and purpose of the group, as well as the number of user-generated contributions. We developed a coding scheme to guide content analysis. Results: We found 620 breast cancer groups on Facebook containing a total of 1,090,397 members. The groups were created for fundraising (277/620, 44.7{\%}), awareness (236, 38.1{\%}), product or service promotion related to fundraising or awareness (61, 9{\%}), or patient/caregiver support (46, 7{\%}). The awareness groups as a whole contained by far the most members (n = 957,289). The majority of groups (532, 85.8{\%}) had 25 wall posts or fewer. The support oriented groups, 47{\%} (27/57) of which were established by high school or college students, were associated with the greatest number of user-generated contributions. Conclusions: Facebook groups have become a popular tool for awareness-raising, fundraising, and support-seeking related to breast cancer attracting over one million users. Given their popularity and reach, further research is warranted to explore the implications of social network sites as a health resource across various health conditions, cultures, ages, and socioeconomic groups.},

However, more intelligent smartphone applications such as context-based search and advertising, early warning systems and city-wide sensing applications may require additional information about smartphone users such as their mobility profiles. To meet more personalized demand of these applications we propose TRACK ME: A new web-based framework for smartphone applications with personalized lightweight mobility service as well as location tracking and mobility profile construction. We showed that our personalized mobility service supports different smartphone applications and it is lightweight enough to provide fast access to the mobility profiles of smartphone users.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efforts to achieve population-wide increases in walking and similar moderate-intensity physical activities potentially can be enhanced through relevant applications of state-of-the-art interactive communication technologies. Yet few systematic efforts to evaluate the efficacy of hand-held computers and similar devices for enhancing physical activity levels have occurred. The purpose of this first-generation study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant [PDA]) for increasing moderate intensity or more vigorous (MOD+) physical activity levels over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults relative to a standard information control arm. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled 8-week experiment. Data were collected in 2005 and analyzed in 2006-2007. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Community-based study of 37 healthy, initially underactive adults aged 50 years and older who were randomized and completed the 8-week study (intervention=19, control=18). INTERVENTION: Participants received an instructional session and a PDA programmed to monitor their physical activity levels twice per day and provide daily and weekly individualized feedback, goal setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate written physical activity educational materials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Physical activity was assessed via the Community Healthy Activities Model Program for Seniors (CHAMPS) questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater 8-week mean estimated caloric expenditure levels and minutes per week in MOD+ activity (p<0.04). Satisfaction with the PDA was reasonably high in this largely PDA-naive sample. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this first-generation study indicate that hand-held computers may be effective tools for increasing initial physical activity levels among underactive adults.},

abstract = {Background: Less than half of U.S. adults engage in the recommended amount of physical activity (PA). Internet-delivered PA programs increase short-term PA but long-term adherence is largely equivocal. Purpose: To determine whether increased PA following the 16-week internet-delivered Active Living Every Day (ALED-I) program is maintained 8 months later in sedentary and overweight rural adults. Methods: In our previous randomized controlled trial (N = 32; 18 intent-to-treat controls, 14 ALED-I interventions), the ALED-I group increased PA (+1384 steps/day; E.S. = 0.95) and reduced central adiposity. Nine original intervention participants and ten delayed intent-to-treat control participants completed ALED-I and an 8-month follow-up. Pedometer-measured PA, anthropometric variables, and cardiometabolic disease risk factors were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at 8 months. Results: Control crossover participants increased PA (+1337 steps/day; P = .04). Eight months following completion of ALED-I (N = 19), PA levels relapsed (-1340 steps/day) and were similar to levels before the intervention (6850 +/- 471 steps/day vs. 6755 543 steps/day; P = .89). Total cholesterol and triglycerides improved, -9.9{\%} and -18.2{\%}, respectively, and reductions in central adiposity were maintained (97.1 +/- 2.2 cm vs. 97.2 +/- 2.2 cm; P = .66). Conclusions: The ALED-I intervention was efficacious in the short-term but did not produce longer-term adherence to PA. Future theory-based internet-delivered interventions that produce habituation of increased PA are warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most evidence-based programs are never translated into community settings and thus never make a public health impact. DESIGN: Active for Life (AFL) was a 4-year translational initiative using a pre-post, quasi-experimental design. Data were collected from 2003 to 2007. Analyses were conducted in 2005 and 2008. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Nine lead organizations at 12 sites participated. Active Choices participants (n=2503) averaged 65.8 years (80{\%} women, 41{\%} non-Hispanic white). Active Living Every Day (ALED) participants (n=3388) averaged 70.6 years (83{\%} women, 64{\%} non-Hispanic white). INTERVENTION: In AFL, Active Choices was a 6-month telephone-based and ALED a 20-week group-based lifestyle behavior change program designed to increase physical activity, and both were grounded in social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model. The interventions were evaluated in Years 1, 3, and 4. An adapted shortened ALED program was evaluated in Year 4. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, assessed with the CHAMPS self-reported measure. RESULTS: Posttest survey response rates were 61{\%} for Active Choices and 70{\%} for ALED. Significant increases in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, total physical activity, and satisfaction with body appearance and function, and decreases in BMI were seen for both programs. Depressive symptoms and perceived stress, both low at pretest, also decreased over time in ALED. Results were generally consistent across years and sites. CONCLUSIONS: Active Choices and ALED were successfully translated across a range of real-world settings. Study samples were substantially larger, more ethnically and economically diverse, and more representative of older adult's health conditions than in efficacy studies, yet the magnitude of effect sizes were comparable.},

abstract = {Objectives: We present a prototype adaptive reminder system for home-based medical tasks. The system consists of a mobile device for reminder presentation and ambient sensors to determine opportune moments for reminder delivery. Our objective was to study interaction with the prototype under naturalistic living conditions and gain insight into factors affecting the long-term acceptability of context-sensitive reminder systems for the home setting. Methods: A volunteer participant used the prototype in a residential research facility while adhering to a regimen of simulated medical tasks for ten days. Some reminders were scheduled at fixed times during the day and some were automatically time-shifted based on sensor data. We made a complete video and sensor record of the stay. Finally, the participant commented about his experiences with the system in a debriefing interview. Results. Based on this case study, including direct observation of individual alert-action sequences, we make four recommendations for designers of context-sensitive adaptive reminder systems. Captured metrics suggest that adaptive reminders led to faster reaction times and were perceived by the participant as being more useful. Conclusions. The evaluation of context-sensitive systems that overlap into domestic lives is challenging. We believe that the ideal experiment is to deploy such systems in real homes and assess performance longitudinally. This case study in an instrumented live-in facility is a step toward that long-term goal.},

abstract = {Objective: To assess impact of exercise education intervention on exercise frequency and attitudes. Methods: Cardiovascular outpatients (N=509) were randomized to receive an education DVD or standard care. Outcome measures (baseline and 6 weeks) assessed exercise frequency and cognitive variables. Results: There was no difference between groups on exercise frequency change from baseline, but DVD group reported greater exercise outcome expectations than control group (P=0.01). There was a greater increase in relapse-prevention behavior in the DVD group, compared to control, for those with low relapse-prevention behavior at baseline (P=0.02). Conclusion: A minimal intervention improves outcome expectations for exercise.},

abstract = {Background: Web-based interventions are popular for promoting healthy lifestyles such as physical activity. However, little is known about user characteristics, adherence, attrition, and predictors of repeated participation on open access physical activity websites. Objective: The focus of this study was Active-online, a Web-based individually tailored physical activity intervention. The aims were (1) to assess and compare user characteristics and adherence to the website (a) in the open access context over time from 2003 to 2009, and (b) between trial participants and open access users; and (2) to analyze attrition and predictors of repeated use among participants in a randomized controlled trial compared with registered open access users. Methods: Data routinely recorded in the Active-online user database were used. Adherence was defined as: the number of pages viewed, the proportion of visits during which a tailored module was begun, the proportion of visits during which tailored feedback was received, and the time spent in the tailored modules. Adherence was analyzed according to six one-year periods (2003-2009) and according to the context (trial or open access) based on first visits and longest visits. Attrition and predictors of repeated participation were compared between trial participants and open access users. Results: The number of recorded visits per year on Active-online decreased from 42,626 in 2003-2004 to 8343 in 2008-2009 (each of six one-year time periods ran from April 23 to April 22 of the following year). The mean age of users was between 38.4 and 43.1 years in all time periods and both contexts. The proportion of women increased from 49.5{\%} in 2003-2004 to 61.3{\%} in 2008-2009 (P<.001). There were differences but no consistent time trends in adherence to Active-online. The mean age of trial participants was 43.1 years, and 74.9{\%} were women. Comparing contexts, adherence was highest for registered open access users. For open access users, adherence was similar during the first and the longest visits; for trial participants, adherence was lower during the first visits and higher during the longest visits. Of registered open access users and trial participants, 25.8{\%} and 67.3{\%} respectively visited Active-online repeatedly (P<.001). Predictors of repeated use were male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 1.2, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-1.38) and increasing age category in registered open access users, and age 46-60 versus < 30 years (OR = 3.04, 95{\%} Cl = 1.25-7.38) and Swiss nationality (ORnonSwiss = 0.64, 95{\%} CI = 0.41-1.00) in trial participants. Despite reminder emails, attrition was much higher in registered open access users compared with trial participants, with a median lifetime website usage of 0 days in open access users and 290 days in trial participants. Conclusions: Adherence, patterns of use, attrition, and repeated participation differed between trial participants and open access users. Reminder emails to encourage repeated participation were effective for trial participants but not for registered open access users. These issues are important when interpreting results of randomized controlled effectiveness trials.},

abstract = {The objective was to describe the utility of mixed methods to inform the development of an automated telephone intervention to improve patients' compliance with asthma medication. As part of intervention development for a larger trial, we conducted 15 focus groups (n = 53) to design and develop calls, and to identify factors influencing intervention acceptability and usefulness. We piloted four call types and interviewed 64 participants to further improve call content and receptivity to the intervention. Feedback led to several changes to the intervention scripts and eventual calls, and an initial pilot led us to drop one of the calls. During the pilot, we reached 43 percent of target participants; 74 percent of those stayed on the call until it ended. This process provided key insights about automated calls, and may have broader applicability for the development of automated interventions designed to help patients manage a variety of chronic conditions.},

Decision makers, as well as consultants, try to identify ways in which firms can make profitable use of applications such as Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, Second Life, and Twitter. Yet despite this interest, there seems to be very limited understanding of what the term “Social Media” exactly means; this article intends to provide some clarification. We begin by describing the concept of Social Media, and discuss how it differs from related concepts such as Web 2.0 and User Generated Content. Based on this definition, we then provide a classification of Social Media which groups applications currently subsumed under the generalized term into more specific categories by characteristic: collaborative projects, blogs, content communities, social networking sites, virtual game worlds, and virtual social worlds. Finally, we present 10 pieces of advice for companies which decide to utilize Social Media.},

abstract = {Although falling is a significant problem for older persons, little is understood about its underlying causes. Spatial cognition and balance maintenance rely on the efficient integration of information across the main senses. We investigated general multisensory efficiency in older persons with a history of falls compared to age- and sensory acuity-matched controls and younger adults using a sound-induced flash illusion. Older fallers were as susceptible to the illusion as age-matched, non-fallers or younger adults at a short delay of 70 ms between the auditory and visual stimuli. Both older adult groups were more susceptible to the illusion at longer SOAs than younger adults. However, with increasing delays between the visual and auditory stimuli, older fallers did not show a decline in the frequency at which the illusion was experienced even with delays of up to 270 ms. We argue that this relatively higher susceptibility to the illusion reflects inefficient audio-visual processing in the central nervous system and has important implications for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of falling in older persons.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to systematically review all published articles examining the relationship between the occurrence of falls and changes in gait and attention-demanding task performance whilst dual tasking amongst older adults. An English and French Medline and Cochrane library search ranging from 1997 to 2008 indexed under 'accidental falls', 'aged OR aged, 80 and over', 'dual task', 'dual tasking', 'gait', 'walking', 'fall' and 'falling' was performed. Of 121 selected studies, fifteen met the selection criteria and were included in the final analysis. The fall rate ranged from 11.1{\%} to 50.0{\%} in retrospective studies and from 21.3{\%} to 42.3{\%} in prospective ones. Amongst the three retrospective and eight prospective studies, two and six studies, respectively, showed a significant relationship between changes in gait performance under dual task and history of falls. The predictive value for falling was particularly efficient amongst frail older adults compared with healthy subjects. Two prospective studies challenged the usefulness of the dual-task paradigm as a significant predictor compared to single task performance and three studies even reported that gait changes whilst dual tasking did not predict falls. The pooled odds ratio for falling was 5.3 (95{\%} CI, 3.1-9.1) when subjects had changes in gait or attention-demanding task performance whilst dual tasking. Despite conflicting early reports, changes in performance whilst dual tasking were significantly associated with an increased risk for falling amongst older adults and frail older adults in particular. Description of health status, standardization of test methodology, increase of sample size and longer follow-up intervals will certainly improve the predictive value of dual-task-based fall risk assessment tests.},

abstract = {Recent advances in telecommunications technology have created opportunities to enhance the quality of health care services through telehealth, the use of telecommunications and information technologies to deliver health care. However, the diverse technologies and applications encompassed by telehealth have tended to confuse discussions of the effectiveness of these programs. An interactive voice response system (IVRS) is a simple, yet effective telehealth application that improves access to health care by continuing care beyond the hospital setting, with specially tailored programs that are easily accessible to patients around the clock. Often described as a telephone connected to a "talking computer," an IVRS allows patient interaction for data collection or to deliver recorded telephone messages related to medication compliance or behavior modification. Despite easy access to touchtone telephone services and growing familiarity with IVRS, many health care providers are unaware of these programs. This paper reviews the infrastructure of IVRS technology and its uses in health care.},

abstract = {Evidence syntheses are used to inform health care policy and practice. Behaviour change theories offer frameworks for categorising and evaluating interventions and identifying likely mechanisms through which effects are achieved. Yet systematic reviews rarely explicitly classify intervention components using theory, which may result in evidence syntheses and health care practice recommendations that are less than optimal. This paper outlines a method for applying theory to evidence syntheses of behaviour change interventions. We illustrate this method with an analysis of 'audit and feedback' interventions, based on data from a Cochrane review. Our analysis is based on Control Theory, which suggests that behaviour change is most likely if feedback is accompanied by comparison with a behavioural target and by action plans, and we coded interventions for these three techniques. Multivariate meta-regression was performed on 85 comparisons from 61 studies. However, few interventions incorporated targets or action plans, and so meta-regression models were likely to be underfitted due to insufficient power. The utility of our approach could not be tested via our analysis because of the limited nature of the audit and feedback interventions. However, we show that conceptualising and categorising interventions using behaviour change theory can reveal the theoretical coherence of interventions and so point towards improvements in intervention design, evaluation and synthesis. The results demonstrate that a theory-based approach to evidence synthesis is feasible, and can prove beneficial in understanding intervention design, even where there is insufficient empirical evidence to reliably synthesise effects of specific intervention components.

abstract = {Background: This paper reviewed a) mass media campaigns and b) 'new media' interventions to promote physical activity. They are different kinds of interventions, with campaigns being mass-reach communications efforts to increase population awareness of physical activity. 'New media' interventions assess the impact of web-based, internet, other 'new media' and e-mail-delivered interventions to increase physical activity. Methods: Previous reviews of mass media campaigns and 'new media' interventions were assessed, and more recent peer-reviewed publications identified using routine electronic databases. For each area, a framework for interventions was described, and evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions, the main outcomes of interest, and methodological strengths and weaknesses were identified. Key recommendations: For mass media campaigns, key recommendations were to use consistent and well-branded messages, and for campaigns to be integrated across local, State and national levels, with sufficient resources to purchase sufficient media. Mass media campaigns should be subject to rigorous formative, process and impact evaluation. For 'new media' interventions, there is clear evidence of effectiveness, but efforts should be made to increase the reach and generalizability of these interventions. They should be provided as a low cost component of integrated communitywide physical activity programs.},

abstract = {Web-based behavioral intervention research is rapidly growing. We review methodological issues shared across Web-based intervention research to help inform future research in this area. We examine measures and their interpretation using exemplar studies and our research. We report on research designs used to evaluate Web-based interventions and recommend newer, blended designs. We review and critique methodological issues associated with recruitment, engagement, and social validity. We suggest that there is value to viewing this burgeoning realm of research from the broader context of behavior change research. We conclude that many studies use blended research designs, that innovative mantling designs such as the Multiphase Optimization Strategy and Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial methods hold considerable promise and should be used more widely, and that Web-based controls should be used instead of usual care or no-treatment controls in public health research. We recommend topics for future research that address participant recruitment, engagement, and social validity.},

abstract = {Computer technology today has expanded the capacity to tailor health information to effectively meet individual healthcare needs. Healthcare professionals need to understand how available computer technologies can assist their practice. This article (1) clarifies the concept of tailoring among similar terms, including targeting, personalizing, and customizing, (2) gives an overview of current literature on the use of computerized tailoring, and (3) provides a model of computerized tailoring through three phases of preparation, adaptation, and integration. Research evidence suggests that health information can be precisely tailored to individuals when using computer technology, although the potential for using technology for tailoring health information has not been fully realized.},

One way to potentially reduce or slow spiraling medical costs is to use technology, not only to cure sickness, but also to promote wellness throughout all stages of life, thereby avoiding or deferring expensive medical treatments. Ubiquitous computing and context-aware algorithms offer a new healthcare opportunity and a new set of research challenges: exploiting emerging consumer electronic devices to motivate healthy behavior as people age by presenting "just-in-time" information at points of decision and behavior.},

@article{Revere2001,
abstract = {Objective: To evaluate evidence of the effectiveness of computer-generated health behavior interventions-clinical encounters "in absentia"-as extensions of face-to-face patient care in an ambulatory setting. Data Sources: Systematic electronic database and manual searches of multiple sources (1996-1999) plus search for gray literature were conducted to identify clinical trials using computer-generated health behavior interventions to motivate individuals to adopt treatment regimens, focusing on patient-interactive interventions and use of health behavior models. Study Selection: Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled studies with some evidence of instrument reliability and validity; use of at least one patient-interactive targeted or tailored feedback, reminder, or educational intervention intended to influence or improve a stated health behavior; and an association between one intervention variable and a health behavior. Data Extraction: Studies were described by delivery device (print, automated telephone, computer, and mobile communication) and intervention type (personalized, targeted, and tailored). We employed qualitative methods to analyze the retrieval set and explore the issue of patient-interactive computer-generated behavioral intervention systems. Data Synthesis: Studies varied widely in methodology, quality, subject number, and characteristics, measurement of effects and health behavior focus. Of 37 eligible trials, 34 (91.9 percent) reported either statistically significant or improved outcomes. Fourteen studies used targeted interventions; 23 used tailored. Of the 14 targeted intervention studies, 13 (92.9 percent) reported improved outcomes. Of the 23 tailored intervention studies, 21 (91.3 percent) reported improved outcomes. Conclusions: The literature indicates that computer-generated health behavior interventions are effective. While there is evidence that tailored interventions can more positively affect health behavior change than can targeted, personalized or generic interventions, there is little research comparing different tailoring protocols with one another. Only those studies using print and telephone devices reported a theoretic basis for their methodology. Future studies need to identify which models are best suited to which health behavior, whether certain delivery devices are more appropriate for different health behaviors, and how ambulatory care can benefit from patients' use of portable devices.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION:: The primary purpose of this study was to examine the accuracy of the Omron HJ-720ITC piezoelectric pedometer in a free-living environment over a 24-h period. A secondary purpose was to compare the accuracy the Omron to that of a spring-levered pedometer. METHODS:: 62 adult volunteers were classified according to BMI category: normal weight (N= 19), overweight (N= 23), and obese (N= 20). Subjects wore five devices over a 24-h period except when bathing or sleeping. The criterion pedometer (StepWatch-3) was worn on the lateral side of the right ankle. Omron HJ-720ITC pedometers were worn in three locations: (a) on the belt, (b) in the pants pocket, and (c) on a lanyard around the neck. A comparison pedometer (Yamax SW-200) was worn on the belt. RESULTS:: The Omron HJ-720ITC underestimated steps per day in all three BMI categories compared to the criterion measure (P < 0.05). The Omron was most accurate in the pocket location, recording 68{\%}, 70{\%}, and 65{\%} of steps in the normal, overweight, and obese BMI categories, respectively. In the obese group, the Omron was more accurate than the Yamax pedometer, but in the normal and overweight groups, it was less accurate than the Yamax. CONCLUSION:: Results from our study show that the Omron significantly underestimates steps per day under free-living conditions. This is due, in part, to the presence of a four-second step filter that contributes to an underestimation of steps accumulated during, intermittent activities. In the pocket, the Omron accuracy was similar for lean, overweight, and obese individuals. In contrast, the Yamax accuracy declined with increasing BMI categories.},

abstract = {Over two-thirds of Americans access the Internet and therefore, the Internet may be an important channel for reaching the large population of sedentary individuals. The purpose of this paper is to describe the methods for a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of an Internet-based physical activity intervention relative to a print intervention that has been shown to be effective in previous trials. Specifically, 249 sedentary participants were randomized to receive one of three interventions: 1) Internet-based motivationally-tailored individualized feedback (Tailored Internet); 2) print-based motivationally-tailored individualized feedback (Tailored Print); or 3) physical activity websites currently available to the public (Standard Internet). Participants completed the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall interview, wore an objective physical activity monitor (i.e., ActiGraph), and participated in a treadmill fitness test at baseline, 6, and 12 months. The sample consisted of mostly women (84.2{\%}) and Caucasian individuals (76.4{\%}) who reported exercising an average of 21 min per week at baseline. This is the first study that we are aware of, that has examined the efficacy of a tailored Internet-based physical activity intervention. This study will have implications for the dissemination of Internet-based physical activity interventions.},

abstract = {Objective: Web-based brief alcohol interventions have the potential to reach a large number of individuals at low cost; however, few controlled evaluations have been conducted to date. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of gender-specific versus gender-nonspecific personalized normative feedback (PNF) with single versus biannual administration in a 2-year randomized controlled trial targeting a large sample of heavy-drinking college students. Method: Participants included 818 freshmen (57.6{\%} women; 42{\%} non-Caucasian) who reported 1 or more heavy-drinking episodes in the previous month at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2 (gender-specific vs. gender-nonspecific PNF) X 2 (single vs. biannual administration of PNF) + 1 (attention control) design. Assessments occurred every 6 months for a 2-year period. Results: Results from hierarchical generalized linear models provided modest effects on weekly drinking and alcohol-related problems but not on heavy episodic drinking. Relative to control, gender-specific biannual PNF was associated with reductions over time in weekly drinking (d = -0.16,95{\%} CI [-0.02, -0.31]), and this effect was partially mediated by changes in perceived norms. For women, but not men, gender-specific biannual PNF was associated with reductions over time in alcohol-related problems relative to control (d = -0.29, 95{\%} CI [-0.15, -0.58]). Few other effects were evident. Conclusions: The present research provides modest support for the use of biannually administered web-based gender-specific PNF as an alternative to more costly indicated prevention strategies.},

abstract = {Background: Patient empowerment is growing in popularity and application. Due to the increasing possibilities of the Internet and eHealth, many initiatives that are aimed at empowering patients are delivered online. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate whether Web-based interventions are effective in increasing patient empowerment compared with usual care or face-to-face interventions. Methods: We performed a systematic review by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from January 1985 to January 2009 for relevant citations. From the 7096 unique citations retrieved from the search strategy, we included 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of review authors assessed the methodological quality of the obtained studies using the Downs and Black checklist. A meta-analysis was performed on studies that measured comparable outcomes. The GRADE approach was used to determine the level of evidence for each outcome. Results: In comparison with usual care or no care, Web-based interventions had a significant positive effect on empowerment measured with the Diabetes Empowerment Scale (2 studies, standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.61, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.29 - 0.94]), on self-efficacy measured with disease-specific self-efficacy scales (9 studies, SMD = 0.23, 95{\%} CI 0.12 - 0.33), and on mastery measured with the Pearlin Mastery Scale (1 study, mean difference [MD] = 2.95, 95{\%} CI 1.66 - 4.24). No effects were found for self-efficacy measured with general self-efficacy scales (3 studies, SMD = 0.05, 95{\%} CI -0.25 to 0.35) or for self-esteem measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (1 study, MD = -0.38, 95{\%} CI -2.45 to 1.69). Furthermore, when comparing Web-based interventions with face-to-face deliveries of the same interventions, no significant (beneficial or harmful) effects were found for mastery (1 study, MD = 1.20, 95{\%} CI -1.73 to 4.13) and self-esteem (1 study, MD = -0.10, 95{\%} CI -0.45 to 0.25). Conclusions: Web-based interventions showed positive effects on empowerment measured with the Diabetes Empowerment Scale, disease-specific self-efficacy scales and the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Because of the low quality of evidence we found, the results should be interpreted with caution. The clinical relevance of the findings can be questioned because the significant effects we found were, in general, small. Clinical Trial: not applicable},

abstract = {Once we bowled in leagues, usually after work -- but no longer. This seemingly small phenomenon symbolizes a significant social change that Robert Putnam has identified in this brilliant volume, Bowling Alone, which The Economist hailed as "a prodigious achievement." Drawing on vast new data that reveal Americans' changing behavior, Putnam shows how we have become increasingly disconnected from one another and how social structures -- whether they be PTA, church, or political parties -- have disintegrated. Until the publication of this groundbreaking work, no one had so deftly diagnosed the harm that these broken bonds have wreaked on our physical and civic health, nor had anyone exalted their fundamental power in creating a society that is happy, healthy, and safe.Like defining works from the past, such as The Lonely Crowd and The Affluent Society, and like the works of C. Wright Mills and Betty Friedan, Putnam's Bowling Alone has identified a central crisis at the heart of our society and suggests what we can do.},

abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the effect of structured vs. non-structured internet-delivered exercise recommendations on aerobic exercise capacity and cardiovascular risk profile in overweight sedentary employees. Methods. 140 employees of an automobile company (11{\%} female, median age 48 years (range 25-60), BMI 29.0 kg/m(2) (25.0-34.8)) were randomized in a 3:2 ratio to an intervention group receiving structured exercise schedules or a control group choosing workouts individually via an interactive website. The 12-week intervention took place in Munich, Germany, during summer 2008. Main outcome measure was performance at the lactate anaerobic threshold (P-AT/kg) during ergometry. Results. 77 participants completed the study. The intervention group (n = 50) improved significantly in P-AT/kg ((mean (SD)) 1.68 (0.31) vs. 1.81 (0.33) W/kg; p = 0.002), VO(2)peak (3.21 (0.63) vs. 3.35 (0.74) L/min; p = 0.04), and waist circumference (100.5 (7.9) vs. 98.0 (7.8) cm; p = 0.001). The control group (n = 27) improved significantly in P-AT/kg (1.59 (0.38) vs. 1.80 (0.49); p<0.001) and waist circumference (101.9 (8.7) vs. 98.3 (8.5) cm; p<0.001), but not in VO2peak. No significant between group differences in these outcome measures were noted. Conclusion. Structured, internet-delivered exercise recommendations are not superior to internet-delivered non-structured exercise recommendations in a workplace setting. Both lifestyle intervention strategies are, however, limited by high dropout rates. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Previous research suggests that older adults may have difficulty attending to simultaneous tasks. This study was conducted to determine how concurrent performance of a secondary cognitive task influences walking and stepping over an obstacle in community dwelling older adults. Twenty-one men and women with a mean age of 73.4 years (S.D. = 5.3) participated in the study. Subjects performed a gait task both alone (single-task condition) and in combination with a cognitive task that involved reciting numbers (dual-task condition). In the gait task, each subject walked at his/her fastest speed along a 10-m walkway and stepped over an obstacle designed to simulate a door threshold. Paired t-tests were used to compare gait parameters (10 m gait speed, gait speed during obstacle approach and negotiation, medial-lateral center of pressure excursion and velocity during obstacle negotiation, foot clearance over the obstacle, step length and foot position relative to the obstacle) and cognitive task performance under single and dual-task conditions. Toe-obstacle distance was greater and obstacle-heel distance was reduced under dual-task conditions. Performance of the remaining gait parameters did not change with the addition of a secondary cognitive task. Cognitive task performance decreased under dual-task conditions. These community dwelling older adults demonstrated minimal or no change in measured gait parameters during simultaneous performance of a cognitive task. The observed decrement in cognitive task performance suggests that subjects may have placed a higher priority on gait performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The authors used recursive partitioning methods to identify combinations of baseline characteristics that predict 2-year physical activity success in each of 3 physical activity interventions delivered in the multisite Activity Counseling Trial. The sample consisted of 874 initially sedentary primary care patients, ages 35-75 years, who were at risk for cardiovascular disease. Predictors of 2-year success were specific to each intervention and represented a range of domains, including physiological, demographic, psychosocial, health-related, and environmental variables. The results indicate how specific patient subgroups (e.g., obese, unfit individuals; high-income individuals in stable health) may respond differently to varying levels and amounts of professional assistance and support. The methods used provide a practical first step toward identifying clinically meaningful patient subgroups for further systematic investigation.},

abstract = {AIMS: To assess Sweet Talk, a text-messaging support system designed to enhance self-efficacy, facilitate uptake of intensive insulin therapy and improve glycaemic control in paediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria; Type 1 diabetes for > 1 year, on conventional insulin therapy, aged 8-18 years. Ninety-two patients were randomized to conventional insulin therapy (n = 28), conventional therapy and Sweet Talk (n = 33) or intensive insulin therapy and Sweet Talk (n = 31). Goal-setting at clinic visits was reinforced by daily text-messages from the Sweet Talk software system, containing personalized goal-specific prompts and messages tailored to patients' age, sex and insulin regimen. RESULTS: HbA(1c) did not change in patients on conventional therapy without or with Sweet Talk (10.3 +/- 1.7 vs. 10.1 +/- 1.7{\%}), but improved in patients randomized to intensive therapy and Sweet Talk (9.2 +/- 2.2{\%}, 95{\%} CI -1.9, -0.5, P < 0.001). Sweet Talk was associated with improvement in diabetes self-efficacy (conventional therapy 56.0 +/- 13.7, conventional therapy plus Sweet Talk 62.1 +/- 6.6, 95{\%} CI +2.6, +7.5, P = 0.003) and self-reported adherence (conventional therapy 70.4 +/- 20.0, conventional therapy plus Sweet Talk 77.2 +/- 16.1, 95{\%} CI +0.4, +17.4, P = 0.042). When surveyed, 82{\%} of patients felt that Sweet Talk had improved their diabetes self-management and 90{\%} wanted to continue receiving messages. CONCLUSIONS: Sweet Talk was associated with improved self-efficacy and adherence; engaging a classically difficult to reach group of young people. While Sweet Talk alone did not improve glycaemic control, it may have had a role in supporting the introduction of intensive insulin therapy. Scheduled, tailored text messaging offers an innovative means of supporting adolescents with diabetes and could be adapted for other health-care settings and chronic diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effects of a trail-walking exercise (TWE) program on the rate of falls in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN Pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTING This trial was conducted in Japan and involved community-dwelling older adults as participants. PARTICIPANTS Sixty participants randomized into a TWE group (n=30) and a walking (W) group (n=30). INTERVENTION Exercise class combined with multicomponent trail walking program, versus exercise class combined with simple indoor walking program. MEASUREMENT Measurement was based on the difference in fall rates between the TWE and W groups. RESULTS Six months after the intervention, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of falls for the TWE group compared with the W group was 0.20 (95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=0.04-0.91); 12 months after the intervention, the IRR of falls for the TWE group compared with the W group was 0.45 (95{\%} CI=0.16-1.77). CONCLUSION The results of this pilot RCT suggest that the TWE program was more effective in improving locomotion and cognitive performance under trail-walking task conditions than walking. In addition, participants who took part in the TWE demonstrated a decrease in the incidence rate of falls 6 months after trial completion. Further confirmation is needed, but this preliminary result may promote a new understanding of accidental falls in older adults.},

abstract = {Background: Advances in ubiquitous computing, smart homes, and sensor technologies enable novel, longitudinal health monitoring applications in the home. Many home monitoring technologies have been proposed to detect health crises, support aging-in-place, and improve medical care. Health professionals and potential end users in the lay public, however, sometimes question whether home health monitoring is justified given the cost and potential invasion of privacy. Objective: The aim of the study was to elicit specific feedback from health professionals and laypeople about how they might use longitudinal health monitoring data for proactive health and well-being. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 8 health professionals and 26 laypeople. Participants were asked to evaluate mock data visualization displays that could be generated by novel home monitoring systems. The mock displays were used to elicit reactions to longitudinal monitoring in the home setting as well as what behaviors, events, and physiological indicators people were interested in tracking. Results: Based on the qualitative data provided by the interviews, lists of benefits of and concerns about health tracking from the perspectives of the practitioners and laypeople were compiled. Variables of particular interest to the interviewees, as well as their specific ideas for applications of collected data, were documented. Conclusions: Based upon these interviews, we recommend that ubiquitous "monitoring" systems maybe more readily adopted if they are developed as tools for personalized, longitudinal self-investigation that help end users learn about the conditions and variables that impact their social, cognitive, and physical health.},

abstract = {Background: Advances in technology allowed the development of a novel smoking cessation program delivered by video messages sent to mobile phones. This social cognitive theory-based intervention (called "STUB IT") used observational learning via short video diary messages from role models going through the quitting process to teach behavioral change techniques. Objective: The objective of our study was to assess the effectiveness of a multimedia mobile phone intervention for smoking cessation. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 6-month follow-up. Participants had to be 16 years of age or over, be current daily smokers, be ready to quit, and have a video message-capable phone. Recruitment targeted younger adults predominantly through radio and online advertising. Registration and data collection were completed online, prompted by text messages. The intervention group received an automated package of video and text messages over 6 months that was tailored to self-selected quit date, role model, and timing of messages. Extra messages were available on demand to beat cravings and address lapses. The control group also set a quit date and received a general health video message sent to their phone every 2 weeks. Results: The target sample size was not achieved due to difficulty recruiting young adult quitters. Of the 226 randomized participants, 47{\%} (107/226) were female and 24{\%} (54/226) were Maori (indigenous population of New Zealand). Their mean age was 27 years (SD 8.7), and there was a high level of nicotine addiction. Continuous abstinence at 6 months was 26.4{\%} (29/110) in the intervention group and 27.6{\%} (32/116) in the control group (P = .8). Feedback from participants indicated that the support provided by the video role models was important and appreciated. Conclusions: This study was not able to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of the complex video messaging mobile phone intervention compared with simple general health video messages via mobile phone. However, there was sufficient positive feedback about the ease of use of this novel intervention, and the support obtained by observing the role model video messages, to warrant further investigation.},

abstract = {Purpose: Given the prevalence of physical inactivity among American adults, convenient, low-cost interventions are strongly indicated. This study determined the 6- and 12-month effectiveness of telephone interventions delivered by health educators or by an automated computer system in promoting physical activity. Design: Initially inactive men and women age 55 years and older (N = 218) in stable health participated. Participants were randomly assigned to human advice, automated advice, or health education control. Measures: The validated 7-day physical activity recall interview was used to estimate minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Physical activity differences by experimental arm were verified on a random subsample via accelerometry. Results: Using intention-to-treat analysis, at 6 months, participants in both interventions, although not differing from one another, showed significant improvements in weekly physical activity compared with controls. These differences were generally maintained at 12 months, with both intervention arms remaining above the target of 150 min per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity on average. Conclusion: Automated telephone-linked delivery systems represent an effective alternative for delivering physical activity advice to inactive older adults.},

Setting: Exercise sessions in a community-based cardiac rehabilitation centre. Patients: Twenty phase III cardiac rehabilitation patients recovering from an acute cardiac event. Main outcome measures: Comparison of heart rates recorded by the two systems and by pulse rate measurement. Results: The Polar monitor gave results very similar to those from Holter monitoring. Intermittent pulse rate measurement gave a limited and less accurate view of the intensity of the exercise session. Conclusion: The Polar heart rate monitor gives accurate readings during cardiac rehabilitation exercise sessions at low cost. It is a useful tool which allows assessment of exercise intensity which is not available from intermittent radial pulse rate measurement.},

@article{Ekeland2010,
abstract = {Objectives: To conduct a review of reviews on the impacts and costs of telemedicine services. Methods: A review of systematic reviews of telemedicine interventions was conducted. Interventions included all e-health interventions, information and communication technologies for communication in health care, Internet based interventions for diagnosis and treatments, and social care if important part of health care and in collaboration with health care for patients with chronic conditions were considered relevant. Each potentially relevant systematic review was assessed in full text by one member of an external expert team, using a revised check list from EPOC (Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group) to assess quality. Qualitative analysis of the included reviews was informed by principles of realist review. Results: In total 1593 titles/abstracts were identified. Following quality assessment, the review included 80 heterogeneous systematic reviews. Twenty-one reviews concluded that telemedicine is effective, 18 found that evidence is promising but incomplete and others that evidence is limited and inconsistent. Emerging themes are the particularly problematic nature of economic analyses of telemedicine, the benefits of telemedicine for patients, and telemedicine as complex and ongoing collaborative achievements in unpredictable processes. Conclusions: The emergence of new topic areas in this dynamic field is notable and reviewers are starting to explore new questions beyond those of clinical and cost-effectiveness. Reviewers point to a continuing need for larger studies of telemedicine as controlled interventions, and more focus on patients' perspectives, economic analyses and on telemedicine innovations as complex processes and ongoing collaborative achievements. Formative assessments are emerging as an area of interest. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Today, more and more health professionals use the Internet to deliver behavioral change interventions, because of its advantage to reach a wide variety of people at low costs. However, little is known about who is interested in and actually participates in such website- delivered programs. Therefore, the purpose of this manuscript was to examine the characteristics of participants and non- participants (parents recruited through schools) in a computer- tailored physical activity intervention delivered through the Internet. Methods: Data was collected in two ways. First, 5706 brochures with a call to participate in a physical activity program, with as key element a website- delivered tailored physical activity advice, were distributed indirectly (through their ildren) to parents of all pupils in 14 primary and secondary schools in Belgium. Parents were asked to return the reply card mentioning if they wanted to participate or not. Second, characteristics of participating and non-participating parents were collected by distributing 2000 short questionnaires to pupils between 10-18 years of age, in 12 of the 14 schools. Chi-square analysis and binary logistic regressions were used to compare characteristics of those parents who showed interest (i. e. positive response on reply card) or actually participated (completed online assessment) in a website-delivered physical activity intervention with the characteristics of those parents who showed no interest or did not participate. Results: In total 1730 pupils (87{\%} respondents), completed the short questionnaire concerning their parents' age, occupation (to derive the socio-economic status) and physical activity habits. The results of the binary logistic regression showed that mothers were more likely to show interest (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.68, p < 0.001) and participate (OR = 2.27, p < 0.005) in the program than fathers. High socioeconomic status (OR = 3.42, p < 0.001) and being employed (OR = 3.03, p < 0.001) were also significant predictors for showing interest but not for participation. Age and physical activity level did neither predict interest nor participation. Conclusion: Both younger and older adults as well as physically active and inactive people participated in our online computer-tailored physical activity program when recruitment was done through schools. However, other health-education programs are still needed to reach all segments of the population equally.},

abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the use of a local neighborhood environment-focused physical activity website and its effects on walking and overall physical activity in middle-aged adults. Method. One-hundred and six (72{\%} women) inactive adults aged 52 +/- 4.6 years were randomly allocated to receive access to a neighborhood environment-focused website, (Neighborhood group, n=52) or a motivational-information website (Comparison group n=54). Participants also received eleven emails over the 26 weeks. Study outcomes were objectively-manitored website use, and self-reported total walking (min/wk), total physical activity (min/wk) and neighborhood walking (min/wk) collected at baseline, 12 and 26 weeks. The study was conducted between August 2005 and February 2006 in Brisbane, Australia. Results. Website use was significantly greater among Neighborhood participants (p=0.01). Statistically significant increases in walking and total physical activity were observed in both groups. There was also a statistically significant interaction effect for total physical activity, with Neighborhood group participants maintaining more of their initial increase in physical activity at week-26 (p<0.05). Further, those in the Neighborhood group who used the website more often reported significantly more walking along the community trail at week-26 (p=0.05) compared with those who did not. Conclusions. A local neighborhood-environment focused physical activity website was more effective at engaging participants than a motivational-information website. Moreover, its use resulted in meaningful increases in physical activity relative to the comparison website. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper describes the application of best practice recommendations for using accelerometers in a physical activity (PA) intervention trial, and the concordance of different methods for measuring PA. A subsample (n = 63; 26{\%}) of the 239 healthy, sedentary adults participating in a PA trial (mean age = 47.5; 82{\%} women) wore the ActiGraph monitor at all 3 assessment time points. ActiGraph data were compared with self-report (i.e.. PA weekly recall and monthly log) and fitness variables. Correlations between the PA recall and ActiGraph for moderate intensity activity ranged from 0.16-0.48 and from 0.28-0.42 for vigorous intensity activity. ActiGraph and fitness [estimated VO(2)(ml/kg/min)] had correlations of 0.15-0.45. The ActiGraph and weekly self-report were significantly correlated at all time points (correlations ranged from 0.23 to 0.44). In terms of detecting intervention effects, intervention groups recorded more minutes of at least moderate-intensity PA on the ActiGraph than the control group at 6 months (min = 46.47, 95{\%} Cl = -14.36-78.58), but not at 12 months. Limitations of the study include a small sample size and only 3 days of ActiGraph monitoring. To obtain optimal results with accelerometers in clinical trials, the authors recommend following best practice recommendations: detailed protocols for monitor use, calibration of monitors and validation of data quality, and use of validated equations for analysis. The ActiGraph has modest concordance with other assessment tools and is sensitive to change over time. However, until more information validating the use of accelerometry in clinical trials becomes available. properly administered self-report measures of PA should remain part of the assessment battery.

abstract = {Although there is a large and growing literature on tailored print health behavior change interventions, it is currently not known if or to what extent tailoring works. The current study provides a meta-analytic review of this literature, with a primary focus on the effects of tailoring. A comprehensive search strategy yielded 57 studies that met inclusion criteria. Those studies-which contained a cumulative N = 58,454-were subsequently meta-analyzed. The sample size-weighted mean effect size of the effects of tailoring on health behavior change was found to be r = .074. Variables that were found to significantly moderate the effect included (a) type of comparison condition, (b) health behavior, (c) type of participant population (both type of recruitment and country of sample), (d) type of print material, (e) number of intervention contacts, (f) length of follow-up, (g) number and type of theoretical concepts tailored on, and (h) whether demographics and/or behavior were tailored on. Implications of these results are discussed and future directions for research on tailored health messages and interventions are offered.},

abstract = {Background: Increasing physical activity is important in the promotion of better health. Computer-tailored behavior change programs have shown promise in changing lifestyle risk factors. Purpose: To provide a narrative systematic review describing the range of evidence on 'second' and 'third' generation computer-tailored primary prevention interventions for physical activity, to determine their effectiveness and key characteristics of success. Unlike previous reviews, this review used specific criteria to measure the external validity of studies, was exclusive to primary prevention interventions in which tailoring was generated through an expert system, and excluded first generation computer-tailored interventions. Methods: Computer-tailored intervention studies published from January 1996-2008 were identified through a search of five databases: Medline; Embase; PsycINFO; CINAHL; and All EBM Reviews and by examining reference lists of relevant articles. Results: Seventeen articles were included, describing the evaluation of 16 interventions, ten of which found significant positive effects of the computer-tailored interventions on physical activity or weight reduction outcomes. Conclusion: The evidence of effectiveness for computer-tailored physical activity interventions is inconclusive. They have potential to reach large groups of people however there is uncertainty whether reported effects are generalizable and sustained.},

abstract = {Background: This paper reviewed a) mass media campaigns and b) 'new media' interventions to promote physical activity. They are different kinds of interventions, with campaigns being mass-reach communications efforts to increase population awareness of physical activity. 'New media' interventions assess the impact of web-based, internet, other 'new media' and e-mail-delivered interventions to increase physical activity. Methods: Previous reviews of mass media campaigns and 'new media' interventions were assessed, and more recent peer-reviewed publications identified using routine electronic databases. For each area, a framework for interventions was described, and evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions, the main outcomes of interest, and methodological strengths and weaknesses were identified. Key recommendations: For mass media campaigns, key recommendations were to use consistent and well-branded messages, and for campaigns to be integrated across local, State and national levels, with sufficient resources to purchase sufficient media. Mass media campaigns should be subject to rigorous formative, process and impact evaluation. For 'new media' interventions, there is clear evidence of effectiveness, but efforts should be made to increase the reach and generalizability of these interventions. They should be provided as a low cost component of integrated communitywide physical activity programs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine a text-messaging program for self-monitoring symptoms of bulimia nervosa (BN) within the context of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). METHOD: Thirty-one women participated in 12 weekly group CBT sessions and a 12 week follow-up. Participants submitted a text message nightly indicating the number of binge eating and purging episodes and rating their urges to binge and purge. Automatic feedback messages were tailored to their self-reported symptoms. RESULTS: Fully 87{\%} of participants adhered to self-monitoring and reported good acceptability. The number of binge eating and purging episodes as well as symptoms of depression (BDI), eating disorder (EDI), and night eating (NES) decreased significantly from baseline to both post-treatment and follow-up. DISCUSSION: Given the frequent use of mobile phones and text-messaging globally, this proof-of-principle study suggests their use may enhance self-monitoring and treatment for BN leading to improved attendance, adherence, engagement in treatment, and remission from the disorder.

@article{Atienza2008,
abstract = {Background: Portable hand-held information technology offers much promise not only in assessing dietary intake in the real world, but also in providing dietary feedback to individuals. However, stringent research designs have not been employed to examine whether it can be effective in modifying dietary behaviors. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant [PDA]) for increasing vegetable and whole-grain intake over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults, using a randomized study design. Methods: Twenty-seven healthy adults aged 50 were randomized and completed the 8-week study. Intervention participants received an instructional session and a PDA programmed to monitor their vegetable and whole-grain intake levels twice per day and to provide daily individualized feedback, goal-setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate, written nutritional education materials. Dietary intake was assessed via the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks. Results: Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater increases in vegetable servings (1.5-2.5 servings/day; p=0.02), as well as a trend toward greater intake of dietary fiber from grains (3.7-4.5 servings/day; p=0.10). Conclusions: This study's findings provide preliminary evidence that using portable hand-held technology to provide daily individualized feedback OD dietary behavior in the real world can increase the dietary intake of healthy food groups.},

@article{Schubart2011a,
abstract = {The objective of this study was to review the evidence about what factors influence user engagement in Internet-based behavioral interventions for chronic illness. We conducted a systematic review of the recent published literature. Searches of MEDLINE (using Ovid and PubMed), The Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, from January 2000 to December 2008, were completed. Additional articles were identified from searching the bibliographies of retrieved articles. We identified studies of interactive health communication interventions delivered via the Internet that, apart from delivering health information, had another component such as interactive tools to manage illness, decision support for treatment, or social support. We restricted the age range to adulthood. The search identified 186 abstracts; 46 articles were reviewed. We used a qualitative approach called "positive deviance" to study those interventions that have succeeded in engaging users where most have failed. Some ways to improve user engagement in Internet interventions suggested by our review include addressing health concerns that are important and relevant to an individual patient or consumer and an individualized approach, such as personally tailored advice and feedback. Interventions that are part of larger health management programs that include clinicians appear to be especially promising.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing technologies create new opportunities for preventive healthcare researchers to deploy behavior modification strategies outside of clinical settings. In this paper, we describe how strategies for motivating behavior change might be embedded within usage patterns of a typical electronic device. This interaction model differs substantially from prior approaches to behavioral modification such as CD-ROMs: sensor-enabled technology can drive interventions that are timelier, tailored, subtle, and even fun. To explore these ideas, we developed a prototype system named ViTo. On one level, ViTo functions as a universal remote control for a home entertainment system. The interface of this device, however, is designed in such a way that it may unobtrusively promote a reduction in the user's television viewing while encouraging an increase in the frequency and quantity of non-sedentary activities. The design of ViTo demonstrates how a variety of behavioral science strategies for motivating behavior change can be carefully woven into the operation of a common consumer electronic device. Results of an exploratory evaluation of a single participant using the system in an instrumented home facility are presented.},

abstract = {Over the last 20 years, heart rate monitors (HRMs) have become a widely used training aid for a variety of sports. The development of new HRMs has also evolved rapidly during the last two decades. In addition to heart rate (HR) responses to exercise, research has recently focused more on heart rate variability (HRV). Increased HRV has been associated with lower mortality rate and is affected by both age and sex. During graded exercise, the majority of studies show that HRV decreases progressively up to moderate intensities, after which it stabilises. There is abundant evidence from cross-sectional studies that trained individuals have higher HRV than untrained individuals. The results from longitudinal studies are equivocal, with some showing increased HRV after training but an equal number of studies showing no differences. The duration of the training programmes might be one of the factors responsible for the versatility of the results.HRMs are mainly used to determine the exercise intensity of a training session or race. Compared with other indications of exercise intensity, HR is easy to monitor, is relatively cheap and can be used in most situations. In addition, HR and HRV could potentially play a role in the prevention and detection of overtraining. The effects of overreaching on submaximal HR are controversial, with some studies showing decreased rates and others no difference. Maximal HR appears to be decreased in almost all 'overreaching' studies. So far, only few studies have investigated HRV changes after a period of intensified training and no firm conclusions can be drawn from these results. The relationship between HR and oxygen uptake (VO(2)) has been used to predict maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)). This method relies upon several assumptions and it has been shown that the results can deviate up to 20{\%} from the true value. The HR-VO(2) relationship is also used to estimate energy expenditure during field conditions. There appears to be general consensus that this method provides a satisfactory estimate of energy expenditure on a group level, but is not very accurate for individual estimations. The relationship between HR and other parameters used to predict and monitor an individual's training status can be influenced by numerous factors. There appears to be a small day-to-day variability in HR and a steady increase during exercise has been observed in most studies. Furthermore, factors such as dehydration and ambient temperature can have a profound effect on the HR-VO(2) relationship.},

abstract = {Mobile phone text messaging is a potentially powerful tool for behavior change because it is widely available, inexpensive, and instant. This systematic review provides an overview of behavior change interventions for disease management and prevention delivered through text messaging. Evidence on behavior change and clinical outcomes was compiled from randomized or quasi-experimental controlled trials of text message interventions published in peer-reviewed journals by June 2009. Only those interventions using text message as the primary mode of communication were included. Study quality was assessed by using a standardized measure. Seventeen articles representing 12 studies (5 disease prevention and 7 disease management) were included. Intervention length ranged from 3 months to 12 months, none had long-term follow-up, and message frequency varied. Of 9 sufficiently powered studies, 8 found evidence to support text messaging as a tool for behavior change. Effects exist across age, minority status, and nationality. Nine countries are represented in this review, but it is problematic that only one is a developing country, given potential benefits of such a widely accessible, relatively inexpensive tool for health behavior change. Methodological issues and gaps in the literature are highlighted, and recommendations for future studies are provided.},

Eight studies compared tailored versus similar nontailored print; one compared tailored print versus an alternate intervention, and three included tailored print as one of several intervention components. Although studies varied by behavioral topic, type of tailoring, and measurement of behavioral outcomes, several themes persist. Compared to their nontailored counterparts, tailored print communications have been consistently better remembered, read, and perceived as relevant and/or credible. There is also evidence that tailored print communications are more effective for influencing health behaviors. Six of the eight tailored/nontailored comparisons found more behavior change among tailored than nontailored recipients. Tailored print communications have also demonstrated effectiveness as an adjunct to other intervention components such as self-help smoking cessation manuals. However, studies comparing tailored print communications with tailoring via other media such as telephone counseling have shown mixed results. Additional research is needed to assess whether the behavioral topic itself may make a difference in whether tailoring is appropriate and effective.},

Patient education programs and materials that are customized to address the unique needs and concerns of specific patients have shown promise in changing a range of health related behavior, although findings to date for physical activity have been equivocal. In this study a randomized controlled trial was conducted among 272 adult primary care patients to compare the effectiveness of tailored, personalized and general health messages, and usual medical care in promoting leisure time physical activity (LTA) and physical activities of daily living (PADLs). Patients in the tailored group were more likely to increase PADLs than were patients in the personalized, general and control groups (65{\%} vs. 46{\%} vs. 56{\%} vs. 54{\%}) and less likely to being doing fewer PADLs at follow-up (18{\%} vs. 38{\%} vs. 38{\%} vs. 38{\%}; chi 2 = 12.2, df = 6, p = 0.056). There were no significant differences for LTAs. To help maximize the effectiveness of future tailored interventions on physical activity, studies should seek to identify the social, psychological and environmental variables that are most important to include in tailored materials.},

abstract = {Mortality rates are lower for married individuals than they are for unmarried individuals, and marriage seems to be even more beneficial to men than women in this regard. A theoretical model of social integration and social control is developed to explain why this may occur. Drawing from this model, I hypothesize that marriage may be beneficial to health because many spouses monitor and attempt to control their spouse's health behaviors. Furthermore, the provision, receipt, and consequences of these social control efforts may vary for men and women. These hypotheses are considered with analysis of a national panel survey conducted in 1986 (N = 3617) and 1989 (N = 2867). Results show that: (1) marriage is associated with receipt of substantially more efforts to control health for men than women, (2) those who attempt to control the health of others are more likely to be female than male, (3) there is some support for the social control and health behavior hypothesis among the married, and (4) the transition from married to unmarried status is associated with an increase in negative health behavior while the transition from unmarried to married status seems to have little effect on health behavior. A theoretical explanation is developed to explain these marital status differences.},

abstract = {Health disparities are a persistent problem worldwide. A major obstacle to reducing health disparities is reliance on "consumable interventions," that is, interventions that, once used, cannot be used again. To reduce health disparities, interventions are required that can be used again and again without losing their therapeutic power, that can reach people even if local health care systems do not provide them with needed health care, and that can be shared globally without taking resources away from the populations where the interventions were developed. This paper presents the argument that automated self-help evidence-based Internet interventions meet the above criteria and can contribute to the reduction of health disparities worldwide. Proof-of-concept studies show that evidence-based Internet interventions can reach hundreds of thousands of people worldwide and could be used in public sector settings to augment existing offerings and provide services not currently available (such as prevention interventions). This paper presents a framework for systematically filling in a matrix composed of columns representing common health problems and rows representing languages. To bring the benefits of evidence-based Internet interventions to the underserved, public sector clinics should establish eHealth resource centers, through which patients could be screened online for common disorders and provided with evidence-based Internet intervention services not currently available at the clinics. These resources should be available in the patients' languages, in formats that do not require literacy, and that can be accessed with mobile devices. Such evidence-based Internet interventions should then be shared with public sector clinics as well as individuals anywhere in the world. Finally, this paper addresses sustainability and describes a continuum of evidence-based Internet interventions to share nationally and across the world. This approach to expanding health service delivery will significantly contribute to a reduction of health disparities worldwide, adding to the often-quoted slogan, " Think globally, act locally," a third line: " Share globally."},

abstract = {Brief planning interventions, usually delivered within paper and pencil questionnaires, have been found to be effective in changing health behaviours. Using a double-blind randomised controlled trial, this study examined the efficacy of two types of planning interventions (action plans and coping plans) in increasing physical activity levels when they are delivered via the internet. Following the completion of self-reported physical activity (primary outcome) and theory of planned behaviour (TPB) measures at baseline, students (N = 1273) were randomised into one of four conditions on the basis of a 2 (received instructions to form action plans or not) x 2 (received instructions to form coping plans or not) factorial design. Physical activity (primary outcome) and TPB measures were completed again at two-month follow-up. An objective measure (attendance at the university's sports facilities) was employed 6 weeks after a follow-up for a duration of 13 weeks (secondary outcome). The interventions did not change self-reported physical activity, attendance at campus sports facilities or TPB measures. This might be due to low adherence to the intervention protocol (ranging from 58.8 to 76.7{\%}). The results of this study suggest that the planning interventions under investigation are ineffective in changing behaviour when delivered online to a sample of participants unaware of the allocation to different conditions. Possible moderators of the effectiveness of planning interventions in changing health behaviours are discussed.},

abstract = {Objective: Meta-analyses of behavior change (BC) interventions typically find large heterogeneity in effectiveness and small effects. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of active BC interventions designed to promote physical activity and healthy eating and investigate whether theoretically specified BC techniques improve outcome. Design: Interventions, evaluated in experimental or quasi-experimental studies, using behavioral and/or cognitive techniques to increase physical activity and healthy eating in adults, were systematically reviewed. Intervention content was reliably classified into 26 BC techniques and the effects of individual techniques, and of a theoretically derived combination of self-regulation techniques, were assessed using meta-regression. Main Outcome Measures: Valid outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating. Results: The 122 evaluations (N = 44,747) produced an overall pooled effect size of 0.31 (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.26 to 0.36, I-2 = 69{\%}). The technique, "self-monitoring," explained the greatest amount of among-study heterogeneity (13{\%}). Interventions that combined self-monitoring with at least one other technique derived from control theory were significantly more effective than the other interventions (0.42 vs. 0.26). Conclusion: Classifying interventions according to component techniques and theoretically derived technique combinations and conducting meta-regression enabled identification of effective components of interventions designed to increase physical activity and healthy eating.},

abstract = {Background: Given the rapid changes in the communication landscape brought about by participative Internet use and social media, it is important to develop a better understanding of these technologies and their impact on health communication. The first step in this effort is to identify the characteristics of current social media users. Up-to-date reporting of current social media use will help monitor the growth of social media and inform health promotion/communication efforts aiming to effectively utilize social media. Objective: The purpose of the study is to identify the sociodemographic and health-related factors associated with current adult social media users in the United States. Methods: Data came from the 2007 iteration of the Health Information National Trends Study (HINTS, N = 7674). HINTS is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey on health-related communication trends and practices. Survey respondents who reported having accessed the Internet (N = 5078) were asked whether, over the past year, they had (1) participated in an online support group, (2) written in a blog, (3) visited a social networking site. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of each type of social media use. Results: Approximately 69{\%} of US adults reported having access to the Internet in 2007. Among Internet users, 5{\%} participated in an online support group, 7{\%} reported blogging, and 23{\%} used a social networking site. Multivariate analysis found that younger age was the only significant predictor of blogging and social networking site participation; a statistically significant linear relationship was observed, with younger categories reporting more frequent use. Younger age, poorer subjective health, and a personal cancer experience predicted support group participation. In general, social media are penetrating the US population independent of education, race/ethnicity, or health care access. Conclusions: Recent growth of social media is not uniformly distributed across age groups; therefore, health communication programs utilizing social media must first consider the age of the targeted population to help ensure that messages reach the intended audience. While racial/ethnic and health status{\&}{\#}8211;related disparities exist in Internet access, among those with Internet access, these characteristics do not affect social media use. This finding suggests that the new technologies, represented by social media, may be changing the communication pattern throughout the United States.},

abstract = {Objective: This article reviews key communication issues involved in the design of effective and humane eHealth applications to help guide strategic development and implementation of health information technologies. Background: There is a communication revolution brewing in the delivery of health care and the promotion of health fueled by the growth of powerful new health information technologies. Conclusion: The development, adoption, and implementation of a broad range of new eHealth applications (such as online health information websites, interactive electronic health records, health decision support programs, tailored health education programs, health care system portals, mobile health communication programs, and advanced telehealth applications) holds tremendous promise to increase consumer and provider access to relevant health information, enhance the quality of care, reduce health care errors, increase collaboration, and encourage the adoption of healthy behaviors. Practice implications: With the growth of new and exciting health information technology opportunities, however, comes the daunting responsibility to design interoperable, easy to use, engaging, and accessible eHealth applications that communicate the right information needed to guide health care and health promotion for diverse audiences.

abstract = {We conducted a community-based anti-obesity programme using mobile phone short message service (SMS) messaging. A total of 927 participants were recruited and visited a public health centre for initial assessment. Mobile phones were used to deliver short messages about diet, exercise and behaviour modification once a week. After a 12-week anti-obesity programme they visited the public health centre again. Four hundred and thirty-three subjects (47{\%}) successfully completed their weight control programme. There were mean reductions of weight, waist circumference and body mass index of 1.6 kg (P < 0.001), 4.3 cm (P < 0.001) and 0.6 kg/m(2) (P < 0.001), respectively. Over two-thirds of the subjects had a reduction in waist circumference of 5-7.5 cm. A post-intervention survey showed that the majority of participants were satisfied with the weekly SMS messages and information brochures delivered by post. SMS messaging may be an effective method of behaviour modification in weight control and anti-obesity health education programmes when promoted by community health centres.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Internet has potential as a medium for health behavior change programs, but no controlled studies have yet evaluated the impact of a fully automated physical activity intervention over several months with real-time objective feedback from a monitor. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the impact of a physical activity program based on the Internet and mobile phone technology provided to individuals for 9 weeks. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, stratified controlled trial was conducted from September to December 2005 in Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, with 77 healthy adults whose mean age was 40.4 years (SD = 7.6) and mean body mass index was 26.3 (SD = 3.4). Participants were randomized to a test group that had access to an Internet and mobile phone-based physical activity program (n = 47) or to a control group (n = 30) that received no support. The test group received tailored solutions for perceived barriers, a schedule to plan weekly exercise sessions with mobile phone and email reminders, a message board to share their experiences with others, and feedback on their level of physical activity. Both groups were issued a wrist-worn accelerometer to monitor their level of physical activity; only the test group received real-time feedback via the Internet. The main outcome measures were accelerometer data and self-report of physical activity. RESULTS: At the end of the study period, the test group reported a significantly greater increase over baseline than did the control group for perceived control (P < .001) and intention/expectation to exercise (P < .001). Intent-to-treat analyses of both the accelerometer data (P = .02) and leisure time self-report data (P = .03) found a higher level of moderate physical activity in the test group. The average increase (over the control group) in accelerometer-measured moderate physical activity was 2 h 18 min per week. The test group also lost more percent body fat than the control group (test group: -2.18, SD = 0.59; control group: -0.17, SD = 0.81; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: A fully automated Internet and mobile phone-based motivation and action support system can significantly increase and maintain the level of physical activity in healthy adults.},

abstract = {Background: The Internet has become a popular medium for the delivery of tailored healthy lifestyle promoting interventions. The actual reach of Internet-delivered interventions seems, however, lower than expected, and attrition from interventions is generally high. Characteristics of an intervention, such as personally tailored feedback and goal setting, are thought to be among the important factors related to of use of and exposure to interventions. However, there is no systematic overview of which characteristics of Internet-delivered interventions may be related to more exposure. Objective: The present study aims to identify (1) which potentially exposure-promoting methods and strategies are used in existing Internet interventions, (2) which objective outcome measures are used to measure exposure to Internet interventions, and (3) which potentially exposure-promoting methods and strategies are associated with better exposure. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted based on the Cochrane guidelines. Papers published between 1995 and 2009 were searched in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. In total, 64 studies were included that reported objective exposure measures such as completion of an initial visit, number of log-ins, and time spent on the website. Information about intervention-related characteristics (ie, interactive behavior change strategies, interactive elements for fun, peer or counsel support, email/phone contact, and regular updates of the website) that could potentially contribute to better exposure and objective exposure outcomes were abstracted from the studies and qualitative systematic descriptive analyses were performed. Results: The results showed that a large variety of behavior change techniques and other exposure-promoting elements were used in the interventions and that these methods and strategies varied for the various lifestyle behaviors. Feedback, interactive elements, and email/phone contact were used most often. In addition, there was much variety and a lack of consistency in the exposure measures that were reported. Of all the categories of intervention characteristics that may be associated with better exposure, there were indications that peer and counselor support result in a longer website visit and that email/phone contact and updates of the website result in more log-ins. Conclusions: Results of this qualitative systematic review indicate that of all intervention characteristics that could potentially enhance exposure, only peer support, counselor support, email/phone contact with visitors, and updates of the intervention website were related to better exposure. The diversity of intervention methods used and the inconsistency in the report of exposure measures prevented us from drawing firmer conclusions. More research is needed to identify whether other characteristics of Internet interventions are associated with greater exposure.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the costs associated with Internet and print-based physical activity interventions. METHOD: The costs associated with delivering tailored print and Internet-based interventions were estimated from a randomized controlled physical activity trial (n=167). The estimates were based on research assistant time sampling surveys, web development invoices, and other tracking procedures. RESULTS: Web-development costs for the Internet intervention were {\$}109,564. Taken together with the website hosting fees and staff costs, the cost per participant per month was {\$}122.52 The cost of the print intervention was {\$}35.81 per participant per month. However, in a break-even analysis, the Internet intervention became more cost-efficient, relative to the print intervention, when the total number of participants exceeded 352. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to print-based interventions, Internet-based interventions may be a more cost efficient way to reach a large number of sedentary individuals.},

abstract = {Purpose. Develop and test a Web site to encourage physical activity (PA) by sedentary workers. Design. Randomized control design with 30-day follow-up. Setting. Large manufacturing plant. Subjects. Included 221 workers; average body mass index was 29.5. Intervention. Get Moving was a repeat-visit Web site providing information and support to develop a personalized PA plan. Measures. Self-reported: PA, depression, anxiety, stage of change, attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, intention, perceived barriers to PA, and motivation. Analysis. Multivariate analysis of covariance and univariate analysis of covariance models were used to compare the two study conditions on posttest outcomes, controlling for baseline Results. Compared with the control group, the treatment group showed significant improvement. The multivariate test was significant (p < .001), with a large effect size (eta(2)=.42). The treatment group differed significantly from the control participants on 11 outcomes (p < .005), with large effect sizes for PA status, min/d, and knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intention. Medium effect sizes were measured for perceived barriers, depressive symptoms, motivation, and self-efficacy. Multiple visits resulted in significantly improved PA, motivation, self-efficacy, and intention, compared with one-time visits. Conclusions. The Get Moving Web site had positive effects and was well received. Interventions Web site have potential to increase the PA of sedentary individuals in worksites and elsewhere, but more research is needed into mediators of Web-based interventions.

abstract = {The burgeoning of consumer health informatics and virtual health care can help people improve their health. However, little is known about individuals' reactions to such systems. We conducted an evaluation of the telephone-linked care (TLC) system, a computer-based telecommunications system, that functions as an at home monitor, educator, and counselor for patients with chronic health conditions. Our multimethod assessment of individuals' reactions to using TLC included both quantitative and qualitative methods. Ethnographic in-depth open-ended interviews indicated more subtle and surprising reactions to TLC than the overall positive responses from surveys: individuals formed personal relationships with this technology. This relationship formation suggests that TLC designers may have been successful in their attempts to emulate a conversation with a human being. Our study adds to evidence that technology can serve as a projective device for peoples' values and psychological issues. Both designers and users project values and goals onto computer-based technologies and take on different identities through it. Different groups of users, therefore, may see the same technology differently. People also form relationships with technologies, as they did with TLC. These findings, as well as implications for system design and health outcomes, need to be explored in additional studies. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {The Internet has become important for the delivery of behavior change interventions. This observational study examines how many people visited, registered and revisited a web-based computer-tailored intervention promoting heart-healthy behaviors when it is implemented for use by the general public. Among registered visitors, the association between visitors' characteristics and initiating, completing and revisiting the website and/or its behavior-specific modules was analyzed. Server statistics showed that 285 146 visitors from unique IP addresses landed on the home page in a 36-month period; of these, > 50{\%} left the intervention website within 30 s. In total, 81 574 (28.6{\%}) visitors completed the registration procedure and gained access to the intervention; 99{\%} of registered visitors initiated one module, 91{\%} completed at least one module and 6{\%} revisited the intervention. The majority of the registered visitors were women, medium to highly educated, with a body mass index (BMI) < 25. Women, visitors aged 40-50 years, visitors with a medium educational level and visitors with a BMI < 25 were more likely to initiate and finish the modules. It is concluded that a heart-healthy computer-tailored Internet program can reach substantial numbers of people, but additional research is needed to develop promotional strategies that reach the high-risk population, i.e. men, older and lower educated persons.},

abstract = {Tailored communications are one of the most promising approaches to smoking cessation interventions for entire populations. Assessments based on the Transtheoretical Model are processed by computer-based expert systems that generate feedback reports tailored to each individual to accelerate their progress through the stages of change for smoking cessation. Seven studies are reviewed that range from a more traditional clinical trial to trials on entire populations of smokers to population trials designed to change multiple behaviours, including smoking. A series of three tailored communications was found to produce long-term point prevalence abstinence rates within the narrow range of 22-26{\%} abstinence. This same range of abstinence was found even when two or three other behaviours (e.g. diet and sun protection) were treated in the population. These results point to a future in which health behaviour risk interventions will be assessed not solely by their efficacy but by their population impact.},

There is limited information about patterns of website use and specific components of an interactive website that might help promote maintenance of weight loss. Objective: This paper presents a secondary analysis of the subset of participants in the Internet arm and focuses on website use patterns and features associated with long-term weight maintenance. Methods: Adults at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) who lost at least 4 kilograms in an initial 20-week group-based, behavioral weight-loss program were trained to use an interactive website for weight loss maintenance. Of the 348 participants, 37{\%} were male and 38{\%} were African American. Mean weight loss was 8.6 kilograms. Participants were encouraged to log in at least weekly and enter a current weight for the 30-month study period. The website contained features that encouraged setting short-term goals, creating action plans, and reinforcing self-management habits. The website also included motivational modules, daily tips, and tailored messages. Based on log-in and weight-entry frequency, we divided participants into three website use categories: consistent, some, and minimal. Results: Participants in the consistent user group (n = 212) were more likely to be older (P = .002), other than African American (P = .02), and more educated (P = .01). While there was no significant difference between website use categories in the amount of Phase I change in body weight (P = .45) or income (P = .78), minimal website users (n = 75) were significantly more likely to have attended fewer Phase I sessions (P = .001) and had a higher initial body mass index (BMI) (P < .001). After adjusting for baseline characteristics including initial BMI, variables most associated with less weight regain included: number of log-ins (P = .001), minutes on the website (P < .001), number of weight entries (P = .002), number of exercise entries (P < .001), and sessions with additional use of website features after weight entry (P = .002). Conclusion: Participants defined as consistent website users of an interactive behavioral website designed to promote maintenance of weight loss were more successful at maintaining long-term weight loss.

abstract = {Background: Effective interventions are needed to reduce the chronic disease epidemic. The Internet has the potential to provide large populations with individual advice at relatively low cost. Objective: The focus of the study was the Web-based tailored physical activity intervention Active-online. The main research questions were (1) How effective is Active-online, compared to a nontailored website, in increasing self-reported and objectively measured physical activity levels in the general population when delivered in a real-life setting? (2) Do respondents recruited for the randomized study differ from spontaneous users of Active-online, and how does effectiveness differ between these groups? (3) What is the impact of frequency and duration of use of Active-online on changes in physical activity behavior? Methods: Volunteers recruited via different media channels completed a Web-based baseline survey and were randomized to Active-online (intervention group) or a nontailored website (control group). In addition, spontaneous users were recruited directly from the Active-online website. In a subgroup of participants, physical activity was measured objectively using accelerometers. Follow-up assessments took place 6 weeks (FU1), 6 months (FU2), and 13 months (FU3) after baseline. Results: A total of 1531 respondents completed the baseline questionnaire (intervention group n = 68 1, control group 11 = 688, spontaneous users n = 162); 133 individuals had valid accelerometer data at baseline. Mean age of the total sample was 43.7 years, and 1146 (74.9{\%}) were women. Mixed linear models (adjusted for sex, age, BMI category, and stage of change) showed a significant increase in self-reported mean minutes spent in moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity from baseline to FU1 (coefficient = 0.14, P = .001) and to FU3 (coefficient = 0.19, P < .001) in all participants with no significant differences between groups. A significant increase in the proportion of individuals meeting the HEPA recommendations (self-reported) was observed in all participants between baseline and FU3 (OR = 1.47, P = .03), with a higher increase in spontaneous users compared to the randomized groups (interaction between FU3 and spontaneous users, OR = 2,95, P = .02). There were no increases in physical activity over time in any group for objectively measured physical activity. A significant relation was found between time spent on the tailored intervention and changes in self-reported physical activity between baseline and FU3 (coefficient = 1.13, P = .03, intervention group and spontaneous users combined). However, this association was no longer significant when adjusting for stage of change. Conclusions: In a real-life setting, Active-online was not more effective than a nontailored website in increasing physical activity levels in volunteers from the general population. Further research may investigate ways of integrating Web-based physical activity interventions in a wider context, for example, primary care or workplace health promotion.},

abstract = {Do 'informed' or 'expert' patients challenge dominant traditions in biomedicine or simply adopt these as conventional ways of thinking about body shape and size, illness and health? This paper examines this question in relation to the use of the weight-loss drug Xenical by participants in an Internet forum for obese and overweight people. Ethnographic and interview data from the forum provides evidence that participants share information and support each other as they use Xenical, and in the process emerge as 'expert patients' in relation to their body shape and its treatment. However, it is argued that while an 'expert patient' can be perceived as desirable, enabling the democratisation of healthcare, it can also be constraining. The exchanges between the users in the forum perpetuate a biomedical model of overweight as a condition to be overcome. The discussion critically considers a number of options for the development of the expert patient, including the emergence of an 'informed consumer'.},

abstract = {Background: An understanding of the factors that predict retention and website use are critical to the development of effective Web-based weight loss interventions. However, poor retention (dropout attrition) and website utilization (nonusage attrition) are major inhibitors to the effectiveness of Web-based programs. Objective: The study aimed to (1) describe the prevalence of dropout and nonusage attrition and (2) examine pretreatment predictors of nonusage attrition in a cohort of commercial Web-based weight loss program participants. Methods: Participants enrolled in the online program, The Biggest Loser Club, Australia, from August 15, 2007, to May 31, 2008. Only those who subscribed for 12 or 52 weeks were included in this study. All data were collected by the program proprietors, SP Health Co Pty Ltd (Sydney, Australia), and provided in "deidentified" form. Data collected included responses to a pretreatment survey (sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics), subscription history (date of enrollment and subscription end), and website use (log-ins, food and exercise diary entries, weigh-ins, and forum posts). Participants were classified as a member of the program at 12 or 52 weeks if they held an active subscription plan at that point in time. Participants were classified as nonusers at 12 or 52 weeks if they had stopped using all of the website features and had not returned. Predictors of nonusage attrition were explored using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: Of the 9599 eligible participants, 6943 (72{\%}) subscribed to the program for 12 weeks, and 2656 (28{\%}) subscribed for 52 weeks. Of all participants, 31{\%} (2975/9599) were classified as overweight, 61{\%} (5866/9599) were classified as obese, 86{\%} (8279/9599) were female, and participants' mean (SD) age was 35.7 (9.5) years. The 12 week and 52 week subscribers' retention rates were 97{\%} and 77{\%} respectively. Of 12 week subscribers, 35{\%} were classified as program "users" after 12 weeks, and 30{\%} of 52 week subscribers were classified as "users" after 52 weeks. Significant predictors of nonusage attrition among 12 week subscribers included age (hazard ratio for 45 to 55 years of age = 0.83, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.93, P = .001; hazard ratio for 55 to 65 years of age = 0.80, 95{\%} CI 0.66-0.99, P = .04), exercise level (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95{\%} CI 0.72-0.81, P < .001), emotional eating (hazard ratio = 1.11, 95{\%} CI 1.04-1.18, P = .001), eating breakfast (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95{\%} CI 0.82-0.95, P = .001), and skipping meals (hazard ratio = 1.12, 95{\%} CI 1.04-1.19, P = .001). For 52 week subscribers, eating breakfast (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95{\%} CI 0.79-0.99, P = .04) and not drinking tea or coffee with sugar (hazard ratio = 1.23, 95{\%} CI 1.11-1.37, P < .001) were the pretreatment characteristics that significantly decreased risk of nonusage attrition. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate a high prevalence of nonusage attrition among a cohort of commercial Web-based weight loss program participants. Several sociodemographic and behavioral factors were shown to independently predict nonusage attrition.},

abstract = {Despite significant efforts, obesity continues to be a major public health problem, and there are surprisingly few effective strategies for its prevention and treatment. We now realize that healthy diet and activity patterns are difficult to maintain in the current physical environment. Recently, it was suggested that the social environment also contributes to obesity. Therefore, using network-based interaction models, we simulate how obesity spreads along social networks and predict the effectiveness of large-scale weight management interventions. For a wide variety of conditions and networks, we show that individuals with similar BMIs will cluster together into groups, and if left unchecked, current social forces will drive these groups toward increasing obesity. Our simulations show that many traditional weight management interventions fail because they target overweight and obese individuals without consideration of their surrounding cluster and wider social network. The popular strategy for dieting with friends is shown to be an ineffective long-term weight loss strategy, whereas dieting with friends of friends can be somewhat more effective by forcing a shift in cluster boundaries. Fortunately, our simulations also show that interventions targeting well-connected and/or normal weight individuals at the edges of a cluster may quickly halt the spread of obesity. Furthermore, by changing social forces and altering the behavior of a small but random assortment of both obese and normal weight individuals, highly effective network-driven strategies can reverse current trends and return large segments of the population to a healthier weight.},

abstract = {There is a need to investigate newer strategies pertaining to the maintenance of healthy behaviors and weight. We investigated the feasibility of mobile phone text messaging to enable ongoing communication with African-American women participating in a weight management program. Ninety-five African-American women participated in this pilot study and received regularly scheduled text messages. Forty-two of these women chose to create 165 personal text messages that included tips on healthy eating and physical activity, as well as reminders to drink water and expressions of encouragement. A commercially available client-based application transmitted these personal messages and general health messages at least three times per week. The software transmitted over 4500 text messages during the first 4 months with 114 returned as undeliverable. Participants expressed generally positive attitudes toward incoming text messages, with only one participant declining to continue after enrollment. This study demonstrated early feasibility and acceptability of text messaging as a method for promoting healthy behaviors for weight maintenance.},

abstract = {Background: Taking a representative snapshot of physical activity intervention trial findings published between 1996 and 2006, we empirically evaluated participant characteristics, response and retention rates, and their associations with intervention settings. Methods: A structured database search identified 5 representative health behavior journals, from which 32 research reports of physical activity intervention trials were reviewed. Interventions settings were categorized as workplace, healthcare, home- or community-based. Information on participant and intervention characteristics was extracted and reviewed. Results: The majority of participants were Caucasian (86{\%}), women (66{\%}), healthy but sedentary (63{\%}), and middle-aged (mean age = 51 years). Intervention response rates ranged from 20{\%} to 89{\%}, with the greatest response rate for healthcare and home-based interventions. Compared with nonparticipants, study participants tended to be women, Caucasian, tertiary-educated, and middle-class. Participants in workplace interventions were younger, more educated, and healthier; in community-based interventions, participants were older and more ethnically diverse. Reporting on education and income was inconsistent. The mean retention rate was 78{\%}, with minimal differences between intervention settings. Conclusions: These results emphasize the need for physical activity interventions to target men, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and ethnic minority populations. Consistent reporting of response rate and retention may enhance the understanding of which intervention settings best recruit and retain large, representative samples.},

@article{Cugelman2011,
abstract = {Background: Researchers and practitioners have developed numerous online interventions that encourage people to reduce their drinking, increase their exercise, and better manage their weight. Motivations to develop eHealth interventions may be driven by the Internet's reach, interactivity, cost-effectiveness, and studies that show online interventions work. However, when designing online interventions suitable for public campaigns, there are few evidence-based guidelines, taxonomies are difficult to apply, many studies lack impact data, and prior meta-analyses are not applicable to large-scale public campaigns targeting voluntary behavioral change. Objectives: This meta-analysis assessed online intervention design features in order to inform the development of online campaigns, such as those employed by social marketers, that seek to encourage voluntary health behavior change. A further objective was to increase understanding of the relationships between intervention adherence, study adherence, and behavioral outcomes. Methods: Drawing on systematic review methods, a combination of 84 query terms were used in 5 bibliographic databases with additional gray literature searches. This resulted in 1271 abstracts and papers; 31 met the inclusion criteria. In total, 29 papers describing 30 interventions were included in the primary meta-analysis, with the 2 additional studies qualifying for the adherence analysis. Using a random effects model, the first analysis estimated the overall effect size, including groupings by control conditions and time factors. The second analysis assessed the impacts of psychological design features that were coded with taxonomies from evidence-based behavioral medicine, persuasive technology, and other behavioral influence fields. These separate systems were integrated into a coding framework model called the communication-based influence components model. Finally, the third analysis assessed the relationships between intervention adherence and behavioral outcomes. Results: The overall impact of online interventions across all studies was small but statistically significant (standardized mean difference effect size d = 0.19, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.11-0.28, P<.001, number of interventions k = 30). The largest impact with a moderate level of efficacy was exerted from online interventions when compared with waitlists and placebos (d = 0.28, 95{\%} CI = 0.17-0.39, P<.001, k = 18), followed by comparison with lower-tech online interventions (d = 0.16, 95{\%} CI = 0.00-0.32, P=.04, k = 8); no significant difference was found when compared with sophisticated print interventions (d = -0.11, 95{\%} CI = -0.34 to 0.12, P = .35, k = 4), though online interventions offer a small effect with the advantage of lower costs and larger reach. Time proved to be a critical factor, with shorter interventions generally achieving larger impacts and greater adherence. For psychological design, most interventions drew from the transtheoretical approach and were goal orientated, deploying numerous influence components aimed at showing users the consequences of their behavior, assisting them in reaching goals, and providing normative pressure. Inconclusive results suggest a relationship between the number of influence components and intervention efficacy. Despite one contradictory correlation, the evidence suggests that study adherence, intervention adherence, and behavioral outcomes are correlated. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that online interventions have the capacity to influence voluntary behaviors, such as those routinely targeted by social marketing campaigns. Given the high reach and low cost of online technologies, the stage may be set for increased public health campaigns that blend interpersonal online systems with mass-media outreach. Such a combination of approaches could help individuals achieve personal goals that, at an individual level, help citizens improve the quality of their lives and at a state level, contribute to healthier societies.},

abstract = {Printed health education materials frequently consist of mass-produced brochures, booklets, or pamphlets designed for a general population audience. Although this one-size-fits-all approach might be appropriate under certain circumstances and even produce small changes at relatively modest costs, it cannot address the unique needs, interests, and concerns of different individuals. With the advent and dissemination of new communication technologies, our ability to collect information from individuals and provide feedback tailored to the specific information collected is not only possible, but practical. The purpose of this article is to: (a) distinguish between tailored print communication and other common communication-based approaches to health education and behavior change; (b) present a theoretical and public health rationale for tailoring health information; and (c) describe the steps involved in creating and delivering tailored print communication programs. Studies suggest computer tailoring is a promising strategy for health education and behavior change. Practitioners and researchers should understand the approach and consider the possibilities it presents for enhancing their work in disease prevention.},

abstract = {In an ongoing effort of this Journal to develop and further the theories, models, and best practices around eHealth research, this paper argues for the need for a “science of attrition”, that is, a need to develop models for discontinuation of eHealth applications and the related phenomenon of participants dropping out of eHealth trials. What I call “law of attrition” here is the observation that in any eHealth trial a substantial proportion of users drop out before completion or stop using the appplication. This feature of eHealth trials is a distinct characteristic compared to, for example, drug trials. The traditional clinical trial and evidence-based medicine paradigm stipulates that high dropout rates make trials less believable. Consequently eHealth researchers tend to gloss over high dropout rates, or not to publish their study results at all, as they see their studies as failures. However, for many eHealth trials, in particular those conducted on the Internet and in particular with self-help applications, high dropout rates may be a natural and typical feature. Usage metrics and determinants of attrition should be highlighted, measured, analyzed, and discussed. This also includes analyzing and reporting the characteristics of the subpopulation for which the application eventually “works”, ie, those who stay in the trial and use it. For the question of what works and what does not, such attrition measures are as important to report as pure efficacy measures from intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. In cases of high dropout rates efficacy measures underestimate the impact of an application on a population which continues to use it. Methods of analyzing attrition curves can be drawn from survival analysis methods, eg, the Kaplan-Meier analysis and proportional hazards regression analysis (Cox model). Measures to be reported include the relative risk of dropping out or of stopping the use of an application, as well as a “usage half-life”, and models reporting demographic and other factors predicting usage discontinuation in a population. Differential dropout or usage rates between two interventions could be a standard metric for the “usability efficacy” of a system. A “run-in and withdrawal” trial design is suggested as a methodological innovation for Internet-based trials with a high number of initial dropouts/nonusers and a stable group of hardcore users.},

abstract = {Recent advances in telecommunications technology have created opportunities to enhance the quality of health care services through telehealth, the use of telecommunications and information technologies to deliver health care. However, the diverse technologies and applications encompassed by telehealth have tended to confuse discussions of the effectiveness of these programs. An interactive voice response system (IVRS) is a simple, yet effective telehealth application that improves access to health care by continuing care beyond the hospital setting, with specially tailored programs that are easily accessible to patients around the clock. Often described as a telephone connected to a "talking computer," an IVRS allows patient interaction for data collection or to deliver recorded telephone messages related to medication compliance or behavior modification. Despite easy access to touchtone telephone services and growing familiarity with IVRS, many health care providers are unaware of these programs. This paper reviews the infrastructure of IVRS technology and its uses in health care.},

abstract = {Background: The composition of habitual diets is associated with adverse or protective effects on aspects of health. Consequently, UK public health policy strongly advocates dietary change for the improvement of population health and emphasises the importance of individual empowerment to improve health. A new and evolving area in the promotion of dietary behavioural change is e-Learning, the use of interactive electronic media to facilitate teaching and learning on a range of issues, including diet and health. The aims of this systematic review are to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adaptive e-Learning for improving dietary behaviours. Methods/Design: The research will consist of a systematic review and a cost-effectiveness analysis. Studies will be considered for the review if they are randomised controlled trials, involving participants aged 13 or over, which evaluate the effectiveness or efficacy of interactive software programmes for improving dietary behaviour. Primary outcome measures will be those related to dietary behaviours, including estimated intakes of energy, nutrients and dietary fibre, or the estimated number of servings per day of foods or food groups. Secondary outcome measures will be objective clinical measures that are likely to respond to changes in dietary behaviours, such as anthropometry or blood biochemistry. Knowledge, self-efficacy, intention and emotion will be examined as mediators of dietary behaviour change in order to explore potential mechanisms of action. Databases will be searched using a comprehensive four-part search strategy, and the results exported to a bibliographic database. Two review authors will independently screen results to identify potentially eligible studies, and will independently extract data from included studies, with any discrepancies at each stage settled by a third author. Standardised forms and criteria will be used. A descriptive analysis of included studies will describe study design, participants, the intervention, and outcomes. Statistical analyses appropriate to the data extracted, and an economic evaluation using a cost-utility analysis, will be undertaken if sufficient data exist, and effective components of successful interventions will be investigated. Discussion: This review aims to provide comprehensive evidence of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adaptive e-Learning interventions for dietary behaviour change, and explore potential psychological mechanisms of action and the effective components of effective interventions. This can inform policy makers and healthcare commissioners in deciding whether e-Learning should be part of a comprehensive response to the improvement of dietary behaviour for health, and if so which components should be present for interventions to be effective.},

abstract = {Background: The Internet is increasingly used as a medium for the delivery of interventions designed to promote health behavior change. However, reviews of these interventions to date have not systematically identified intervention characteristics and linked these to effectiveness. Objectives: The present review sought to capitalize on recently published coding frames for assessing use of theory and behavior change techniques to investigate which characteristics of Internet-based interventions best promote health behavior change. In addition, we wanted to develop a novel coding scheme for assessing mode of delivery in Internet-based interventions and also to link different modes to effect sizes. Methods: We conducted a computerized search of the databases indexed by ISI Web of Knowledge (including BIOSIS Previews and Medline) between 2000 and 2008. Studies were included if (1) the primary components of the intervention were delivered via the Internet, (2) participants were randomly assigned to conditions, and (3) a measure of behavior related to health was taken after the intervention. Results: We found 85 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, providing a total sample size of 43,236 participants. On average, interventions had a statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior (d(+) = 0.16, 95{\%} CI 0.09 to 0.23). More extensive use of theory was associated with increases in effect size (P = .049), and, in particular, interventions based on the theory of planned behavior tended to have substantial effects on behavior (d(+) = 0.36, 95{\%} CI 0.15 to 0.56). Interventions that incorporated more behavior change techniques also tended to have larger effects compared to interventions that incorporated fewer techniques (P < .001). Finally, the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions was enhanced by the use of additional methods of communicating with participants, especially the use of short message service (SMS), or text, messages. Conclusions: The review provides a framework for the development of a science of Internet-based interventions, and our findings provide a rationale for investing in more intensive theory-based interventions that incorporate multiple behavior change techniques and modes of delivery.},

abstract = {Objective: To comprehensively describe the populations, interventions, and outcomes of interactive voice response system (IVRS) clinical trials. Methods: We identified studies using MEDLINE (1950-2008) and EMBASE (1980-2008). We also identified studies using hand searches of the Science Citation Index and the reference lists of included articles. Included were randomized and controlled clinical trials that examined the effect of an IVRS intervention on clinical end points, measures of disease control, process adherence, or quality-of-life measures. Continuous and dichotomous outcomes were meta-analyzed using mean difference and median effects methodology, respectively. Results: Forty studies (n = 106,959 patients) met inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 25 used an IVRS intervention aimed at encouraging adherence with recommended tests, treatments, or behaviors; the remaining 15 used an IVRS for chronic disease management. Three studies reported clinical end points, which could not be statistically pooled. In 6 studies that reported objective clinical measures of disease control (glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, and serum glucose), the IVRS was associated with nonsignificant improvements. In 14 studies that measured objective process adherence outcomes, the median effect was 7.9{\%} (25th-75th percentile: 2.8{\%}, 19.5{\%}). For the 16 studies that assessed patient-reported measures of disease control and the 11 studies that assessed patient-reported process adherence outcomes, approximately one-third of the outcomes significantly favored the IVRS group. Conclusion: IVRS interventions, which enable patients to interact with computer databases via telephone, have shown a significant benefit in adherence to various processes of care. Future IVRS studies should include clinically relevant outcomes. (Am J Manag Care. 2009; 15(6): 383-391)},

abstract = {Automated health behavior interventions that involve discretionary use by patients or consumers over extended periods of time are becoming more common and it is generally assumed that adherence to the recommended schedule is related to the impact of the system on users. Yet reasons for use or non-use of such systems have not been carefully explored. An understanding of factors that influence people to use, not use, or underutilize these automated behavioral change and self-care management systems can help in designing systems that are more effective and acceptable to users. Using qualitative research methods, this study explored the experiences of 45 users of a multiple-contact health promotion application with the goal of understanding the major factors that affect patterns of use (frequency of and duration of contact). The in-depth exploration of users' perceptions and views made possible by the qualitative research methods revealed a number of important themes. Reported reasons for underutilization or non-use were found to be both user-related and system-related. User-related reasons encompassed personal and individual events that prevented or impeded system utilization. System-related reasons included those that related to the medium itself as well as the content of the application. The qualitative methods employed in this study created a forum through which users' feedback could be fully explored and then synthesized to assist in the improvement of this and other automated health behavior interventions. {\&}COPY; 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we measure effects of interrupting a user at different moments within task execution in terms of task performance, emotional state, and social attribution. Task models were developed using event perception techniques, and the resulting models were used to identify interruption timings based on a user’s predicted cognitive load. Our results show that different interruption moments have different impacts on user emotional state and positive social attribution, and suggest that a system could enable a user to maintain a high level of awareness while mitigating the disruptive effects of interruption. We discuss implications of these results for the design of an attention manager.},

Further, new ubiquitous computing and mobile computing devices permit information to be conveyed to users at just the right place.

Breakaway uses the information from sensors placed on an office chair to communicate in a non-obtrusive manner how long the user has been sitting. Breakaway is a small sculpture placed on the desk. Its design is inspired by animation arts and theater, which rely heavily on body language to express emotions. Its shape and movement reflect the form of the human body; an upright position reflecting the body's refreshed pose, and a slouching position reflecting the body's pose after sitting for a long time. An initial evaluation shows a correlation between the movement of the sculpture and when participants took breaks, suggesting that ambient displays that make use of aesthetic and lifelike form might be promising for making positive changes in human behavior.},

abstract = {There is growing global concern over the growing levels of obesity and the fact that people in general are not as active as they once were. Many believe that this is directly related to poor diet and our increasing reliance on technology, such as television, social networking, computer games, and voice activated home control systems. These kinds of activities increase sedentary behaviour across all age groups and is considered one of the main contributors to obesity and poor health. For this reason decreasing sedentary behaviour is considered a crucial theme within many research programs in health. Ironically, there is general agreement that the use of technology is likely to help researchers understand this type of behaviour. One interesting approach is based upon the use of human digital memories to provide visual lifelogs of a users activity and to identify the behaviour patterns of individuals. In this way visual lifelogs provide a way for users to evaluate their lifestyle choices. This paper discusses some of the key technologies used to achieve this and considers some of the challenges that still need to be addressed.},

abstract = {While our Y2K worries about old computers "retiring" at midnight captured the television and news media attention, a more significant "old age" phenomenon snuck onto the scene with hardly a headline: the dawn of the age of the aged. (1) The over burdened health care system will face a worldwide wave of retirees who will live longer, cost more to treat, and demand new goods and services to help them stay healthy, active, and independent. Research in persuasive technologies and the associated usage of a computing system, device, or application intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior in a predetermined way is showing the potential to assist in improving healthy living, reduce the costs on the health care system, and allow the aged to maintain a more independent life. This article gives a deeper insight into the evolution of persuasive technologies and presents a framework that can guide a researcher or practitioner in comprehending more effectively the work being done in this novel research field. It also provides categories of domains within health care in which these technologies are used and surveys exemplars from published literature. The article's goal is to provide greater understanding by addressing the challenges that lie ahead for all key stakeholders that design and/or use persuasive technologies in health care.},

abstract = {Repetitive strain injuries and ergonomics concerns have become increasingly significant health issues as a growing number of individuals frequently use computers for long periods of time. Currently, limited software mechanisms exist for managing ergonomics; the most well-known are “break-reminder” packages that schedule and recommend typing breaks. Yet despite the proven benefits of taking breaks, such packages are rarely adopted due to the over- head of introducing periodic interruptions into a user’s workflow. In this paper, we describe SuperBreak, a break- reminder package that provides hands-free interactions dur- ing breaks, with the goal of encouraging users to take more breaks and enhancing the benefits of those breaks. In a field study of 26 knowledge workers, 85{\%} preferred SuperBreak over a traditional break-reminder system, and on average participants took a higher percentage of the interactive breaks suggested to them. Our results highlight the value of interactivity for improving the adoption and retention of ergonomic break practices.},

Field Study: 2 weeks, with 26 participants
No control group, but each participant had a week using the interactive break SW and then another week not using the interactive SW, but still with reminders probably. 13 of them already have experience with Break SW

Focuses on micro-breaks: 20 sec break every 5 minutes.
It doesn't detect physical activity but monitors keyboard and mouse activity to decide if a micro-break is needed

Users has to engage in an activity during the break. Some were active and others were passive. 
One active break sought to help users continue to work. 
All the detection during the activity break is done using a vision technique with a web cam},

Our strategies use theory and prior work to substantially extend a set of existing design goals. Our extensions specifically account for social characteristics and other tactics that should be supported by persuasive technologies that target long-term discretionary use throughout everyday life. We used these strategies to design and build a system that encourages people to lead a physically active lifestyle. Results from two field studies of the system—a three-week trial and a three-month experiment—have shown that the system was successful at helping people maintain a more physically active lifestyle and validate the usefulness of the strategies.},

Summary: 
we use concepts from behavioral and social psychological theories to shape an understanding of how to design technology to support behavior change while supporting fundamental social needs
Two field studies of our system—a three-week trial and a three-month experiment—
In this paper, we illustrate how ideas from these two theories can be valuable for persuasive technologies. (Cog Dissonance Th {\&}amp; Presentation of Self))
The paper focuses on supporting individual. They claim that even though the insights foundin this paper may be used as foundation they may not directly map 
Theories used:
Draw from Goal-Setting Theory, {\&}amp; Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change both often usd in persuasive technology and health intervention research (p.406)
Design persuasive syst targeting contemplators, preparation stagers, action stagers, or maintainers. The syst would be different for each one. 
Bc indvs are likely to use the technology throughout everyday life, soc psychology for theories that focus on how individuals manage their daily behaviors as part of a larger social context (p. 406). Thus they adopt Presentation of Self in Everyday Life 
They also use Cognitive Dissonance Theory

Implications of Presentation of Self Technology to encourage lifestyle behavior change must support fundamental impression management needs. Effective support implies that the individual should be in control of information about her that is collected and how that information is used.
Cognitive Dissonance Theory [6] explains what happens when an individual realizes that her attitudes and behaviors are inconsistent
Recent Persuasive TEch Research: 
1. Breakaway: encourages users at work to get up and take breaks by visualizing a person slumping next to the monitor
2. Fish n' Steps
3. Houston 
Design Stragegies: 
8 Design goals:
1. Abstract {\&}amp; reflective:
use data abstraction rather than raw or explicit data to display info to encourage the user to reflect on his/her beaharios by showing what she has done and how those behaviors relate to his/her goal
2. Unobstrusive: while presenting and collecting data, without interrupting unnnecessarily everyday life
3. Public: present data that is personal, st the user is comfortable sharing if it such thing occurs
4. Aesthetic: display used over time, needs to be inquisitive {\&}amp; sustain interest. Comfort {\&}amp; attractiveness
5. Positive: use positive reinforcement, reward user for perfoming the desired behavior, attaining goal. If desired goal not performed, the user should not receive reward nor punishement, but his/her interest should be
6. Controllable: give user control over their data. 
Credibility is key when computing products report measurements. If reported measurements are questionable or obviously inaccurate, the products will lose credibility. If the product were designed to influence or motivate, it likely would fail because of the inaccurate measurements it had reported. 
7. Trending/Historical: 
Credibility is key when computing products report measurements. If reported measurements are questionable or obviously inaccurate, the products will lose credibility. If the product were designed to influence or motivate, it likely would fail because of the inaccurate measurements it had reported. 
7. Trending/Historical: Provide reasonable and accessible info about user's past beahbior as it related to their goals.
If the individual considers each decision in isolation, and not based on a history of decisions, it is easy for her to make a “poor decision,” as it often leads to immediate satisfaction 
8. Comprehensive: Account for range of behavios that contribute to the user's desired lifestyle; do not artificially limit data collection {\&}amp; representation to the specific behavrios that the technology can sensor or monitor.
Like the issue that happened with the pedometers/Houston. Wouldn't count for biking, only step exercises. This might discourage bc didn't allow for manual input.
Takeaways for SMART: The system should take into account the stages in which the individual might be and apply certains apps or system based on what they stage they might be considered to be in.},

@article{Williams2011,
abstract = {There is convincing evidence that targeting self-efficacy is an effective means of increasing physical activity. However, evidence concerning which are the most effective techniques for changing self-efficacy and thereby physical activity is lacking. The present review aims to estimate the association between specific intervention techniques used in physical activity interventions and change obtained in both self-efficacy and physical activity behaviour. A systematic search yielded 27 physical activity intervention studies for 'healthy' adults that reported self-efficacy and physical activity data. A small, yet significant (P < 0.01) effect of the interventions was found on change in self-efficacy and physical activity (d = 0.16 and 0.21, respectively). When a technique was associated with a change in effect sizes for self-efficacy, it also tended to be associated with a change (r(s) = 0.690, P < 0.001) in effect size for physical activity. Moderator analyses found that 'action planning', 'provide instruction' and 'reinforcing effort towards behaviour' were associated with significantly higher levels of both self-efficacy and physical activity. 'Relapse prevention' and 'setting graded tasks' were associated with significantly lower self-efficacy and physical activity levels. This meta-analysis provides evidence for which psychological techniques are most effective for changing self-efficacy and physical activity.},

abstract = {We present a technique for evaluating the usability and effectiveness of ambient displays. Ambient displays are abstract and aesthetic peripheral displays portraying non-critical information on the periphery of a user’s at- tention. Although many innovative displays have been published, little existing work has focused on their eval- uation, in part because evaluation of ambient displays is difficult and costly. We adapted a low-cost evaluation technique, heuristic evaluation, for use with ambient dis- plays. With the help of ambient display designers, we defined a modified set of heuristics. We compared the performance of Nielsen’s heuristics and our heuristics on two ambient displays. Evaluators using our heuristics found more, severe problems than evaluators using Niel- sen’s heuristics. Additionally, when using our heuristics, 3-5 evaluators were able to identify 40-60{\%} of known usability issues. This implies that heuristic evaluation is an effective technique for identifying usability issues with ambient displays.},

Presents a technique to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of ambient displays. It comapres performance of Nielsen's heuristics and compares it with their own heuristics on 2 ambient displays.
Problem: little is known what makes one ambient display more effective than another, or how to evaluate these displays. 
The majority of ambient displays that have been published have not been evaluated. 
Table 1 very good heuristics details. 
The most common {\&}quot;finding{\&}quot; of empirical studies is that users are interested in and excited by innovations in ambient displays. 
Heuristic Evaluation to verify that they were at least minimally appropriate to the task for which they were designed. 
- Ambient displays should not be interruptive
- AD should inc a user's enjoyment or engagement

Nielsen found that 3-5 novice evaluators find 40- 60{\%} of known issues when applying heuristic evaluation [18]. The canonical list of heuristics as defined by Niel- sen is [15]: (1) Visibility of system status; (2) Match between system and the real world; (3) User control and freedom; (4) Consistency and standards; (5) Error prevention; (6) Recognition rather than recall; (7) Flexi- bility and efficiency of use; (8) Aesthetic and minimalist design; (9) Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors; (10) Help and documentation.

Ambient display users are passive in obtaining information from a display. Users do not use the displays as they would use com- puters; they perceive the displays.

It turns out Neilsen's heuristics were not appropriate for ambient displays, bc they assume interactive, productivity-oriented systems, while ambient displays may not be interactive, and support monitoring ra ther than efficeincy
Analytics used:
- Used Spearman's rho with p for analyzing correlation
- Likert scale response
- univariate analysis of var test, comparting the {\#} of cases and average severity of each issue found with each heuristic set and display as factors.},
