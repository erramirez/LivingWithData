# Methods
## Research Design.
This study was designed to elicit both qualitative and quantitative information from individuals who had been using a physical activity tracking device (Fitbit) for long period of time (>= 90 days). Participants recruited to participate in this research study will be asked to complete two phases in order to participate in the study. In the initial phase participants who met the inclusion criteria and consented to be included in the study were asked to connect their Fitbit accounts to the Fitabase analytics system (Small Steps Labs, San Diego, CA, USA). This allowed participants to grant access to their historical data, collected through their Fitbit device, to the investigator. Once participants completed phase one they were asked to take part in a two-stage interview in-person, via phone, or via a web-video conference. Each interview was designed to last between 1.5 and 2 hours. The first stage of the interview consisted of gathering demographic data and completing various psychosocial measures. This lasted approximately 30 minutes. The second stage of the interview was a semi-structured interview and conversation with the pariticpant that covered a variety of topics related to the participants’ use of the Fitbit, the participants’ relationship with the data it collects, and the use of behavior change techniques. The institutional review board from the Univeristy of California, San Diego approved this study.

### Setting
As participants were able to complete both phases of the study remotely, this study was open to individuals living in the United States and abroad.

### Recruitment
Participants were recruited through a variety of web and personal channels. Recruitment materials (see appendix TK) that described the study were posted to the following locations:

* Fitbit subreddit (available at http://reddit.com/r/fitbit)
* Fitbit discussion forums (available at https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Discussions/ct-p/discussions)
* Quantifiedself.com forums (available at https://forum.quantifiedself.com)
* Quantified Self Facebook group (available at https://www.facebook.com/groups/quantifiedself/)

These online groups and websites are open to the public and are used to announce events and opportunities, engage in open discussion, and coordinate group activities. The primary investigator posted under his own account or under an account labeled, "UCSDFitbitStudy". Snowball sampling was also used to recruit additional participants. At the conclusion of the interview participants were asked to recommend study participation to individuals who are listed in their “Fitbit Friends” network and additional friends or family who meet the inclusion criteria. Additional copies of of the recruitment materials were provided to participants who expressed interest in sharing the study with others. All recruitment materials prompted individuals to contact the primary investigator via email (erramirez@ucsd.edu) if they were interested in participating. The primary investigator replied to all individuals who expressed interest with additional information about the study and a prompt to schedule a brief (10 to 15  minute) screening phone call. If the individual met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (described below) they were provided a copy of the informed consent and the study methods were described in detail. If the individual consented to be a participant in the study they were prompted to schedule an interview with the primary investigator and were given detailed instructions on how to connect their Fitbit account to the Fitabase analytics system.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria consisted of: 1) men and women between 18 and 60 years old, 2) current user of a Fitbit activity tracking device, 3) a minumum of 90 days of use of any combination of Fibit activity tracking devices, 4) the ability to use video teleconferencing systems (e.g. Skype, Google Hangout, Facetime), 5) willing and able authorize the primary investigator to access and download a copy of Fitbit data vis the Fitabase analytics system, 6) no more than six (20% of total sample size) particiapnts who identify as early adopters of self-tracking practices as derived from their membership in Quantified Self meetup groups or online communities. Participants were not excluded based on ethnic background, location, or health status.

## Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures

### Fitbit Data Collection
In addition to the user-centered components of the Fitbit system (device, application, and dashboard), Fitbit has developed and provides access to an application programming interface (API) so that outside entities can build tools and services to enhance the user experience. The API allows a third party to access and add to the data currently gathered and stored in the Fitbit database. These read/write privileges allow an application developer to build visualizations, reminder tools, and add additional services to existing behavioral or data storage platforms.

In order to access Fitbit data from research participants, the Fitabase service was used. Fitabase provides a simple platform for authenticating participants and accessing the data gathered while using a Fitbit device. Fitabase has been chosen because all data is stored in a secure server, and its history of collaboration with research institutions [@Cadmus-Bertram2015; Choi2015; @Diaz2015a; @Hartman2015; @Schaefer2016]. Participants were be asked to authorize the Fitabase system to access their Fitbit data and make it available for download for analysis. All participants authorized the Fitabase system via an online portal.

Online Authorization. The participant was asked for a valid email address to send the authorization link. The author then created a profile for the participant that included their assigned unique study identifier. A link to Fitabase Authorization Page was then emailed to the participant. The online Fitabase Authorization Page contains the same text as the Fitabase Authorization page (Appendix TK). At the bottom of the online Fitabase Authorization page a “connect your device” button was present. The participant was asked to read the authorization page and if they agreed, to connect their Fitbit and authorize Fitabase to read and access their Fitbti data. It important to note that the personal login information for each particiapnt was be entered outside of the view of the author and is not passed to the Fitabase system (it uses the OAuth protocol established for API authentication). When the participant entered their information and connected their Fitbit account to Fitabase the online authorization was completed. This completion also signaled an acceptance of the Fitabase Terms of Use and Privacy Policy [@Fitabase2016].

### Fitbit Data
For each participant, the data at the interday (daily aggregate values) level, and at the intraday (minute-by-minute values) level was available for downloading and analysis. At the interday level the following data was downloaed: Steps, Distance Traveled, Very Active Minutes, Fairly Active Minutes, Lightly Active Minutes, Sedendaty Minutes, and Estimated Energy Expenditure. At the intraday level, the following data is avaialble and was downloaded: Steps, Intensity Classifcation, MET Values, and Estimated Energy Expenditure. All Fitabase data files were downloaded in CSV format.

### Interview
A short set of interview questions was be prepared prior to recruitment and was refined to reflect emerging knowledge as the research process progressed. The interviews were conducted in order to uncover the narratives and processes that reflect the realty of using a physical activity tracker. An Informed Grounded Theory approach was used to transcribe, code, and identify themes from the interviews. This approach is based on the use of prior research and literature to inform and focus attention on specific ideas or concepts during the qualitative research process (Thornberg, 2012). By using prior research, specifically the 93 BCTs in the BCTTv1, as well as findings from similarly designed studies, this process built on existing knowledge while simultaneously being open to the identification of new and unique themes and phenomena related to physical activity tracker use.
### Demographic Information.
Participants completed a demographic questionnaire that included birth year, gender, race/ethnicity, education, height, weight, marital status, and household income.

### 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR)
The 7-Day PAR is a validated, interview-administered, semi-structured physical activity recall survey [@Sallis1985a]. Participants were asked to recall their sleep and physical activity behaviors (and corresponding intensities) for the previous seven days.

### Psychosocial Survey
All participants were asked to complete a psychosocial survey designed to identify various aspects of physical activity behavior and thought processes. These measures, designed and validated for use with adult men and women include short surveys to determine decisional balance, self-efficacy, behavior change strategies, and social support related to physical activity behavior [@Carlson2012].


### Coding Interviews




>The current study will not be examining sleep, weight, or dietary data. If that data is present for a participant via the Fitabase interface it will not be viewed, downloaded, or saved as part of this research protocol. Fitabase has provided a document explaining their privacy and security protocols. It is included in this application: Fitbit_SecurityPrivacy.docx

>In order to access Fitbit data from research participants the Fitabase data tool will be used. Fitabase provides a simple platform for authenticating participants and accessing the data they’ve gathered while using a Fitbit device. Fitabase has been chosen because all data is stored in a secure server, it’s history of collaboration with research institutions, and the ability to gather non-activity data associated with a participant’s Fitbit account (see Appendix TK). The data types available from the Fitabase system include:
