Physical Activity & Public Health
---------------------------------

### Physical Activity and Health

Much of the current literature on the health behaviors related to physical activity and exercise has focused on determining prescription-like recommendations. These recommendations have been thought to be necessary to provide the public with a roadmap towards reducing the burden of preventable chronic health conditions. The newest guidelines adopted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services offer separate recommendations based on age (youth, adults, and elderly), and on the type (strength vs. aerobic) and intensity of exercise (moderate vs. vigorous) (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008). While recommending a standard of two days a week of strength training plus 150 min/week of moderate physical activity, 75 min/week of vigorous activity, or any "equivalent combination" of these two intensities does serve to give the general public concrete guidelines to follow, the results of these and similar published guidelines has been less that favorable. A large proportion of the population continues to lead primarily inactive lives. According to objective accelerometer data from the 2003-04 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey approximately 95% of adults (over 19 yrs) did not engage in the recommended amount of daily physical activity (Troiano et al., 2008). It should not be surprising then that the prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to rise with approximately 32% of the American adult population being classified as such (Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, and Curtin, 2010; Ogden et al., 2006). In addition to obesity, lack of physical activity has been shown to be related to increased risk of premature mortality, reduction in cardiovascular health, and degradation of muscular and skeletal health (Lee and Skerrett, 2001; Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing, and Hsieh, 1986). There is a clear need to improve individual’s engagement with regular health-enhancing physical activity behavior.

\#\#\# Pedometers The invention of the pedometer can be traced back to Leonardo de Vinci and includes a tale of invention and re-invention by, among others, Thomas Jefferson. Regardless of its invention, the popularity of pedometers for measuring and displaying the number of steps an individual takes has a long history in the research literature. The first mention of the pedometer in the research literature is a letter to the editor in the December 13, 1912 edition of Science, wherein the author (identified only as T.C.M.) describes the pedometer as,

> “A most useful addition to the outfit of a traveler and an especially delightful and comforting companion to those who know the joy of seeing the world à piede.” (T.C.M., 1912)

He further explains the difference between the wrong kind of pedometer (which only counts steps) and the right kind (which counts distance). Type aside, the pedometer as a step measuring and tracking device became part of the public consciousness as a result of the widespread popularity of walking clubs in Japan. (Tudor-Locke and Bassett, 2004) describes a 2001 presentation at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine during which Dr. Yoshiro Hatano explained the rise in popularity of the pedometer and the now widely adopted 10,000 steps per day guideline. In the 1960’s the pedometer company, Yamasa Corportaion (which sells pedometers under the Yamax brand in the U.S.), sold a pedometer under their nickname manpo-kei, which translated means “ten thousand step meter.” (Tudor-Locke and Bassett, 2004; Tudor-Locke, Hatano, Pangrazi, and Kang, 2008).

The pedometer has been widely use a measurement tool and intervention component in physical activity and broader public health research. As a measurement tool, pedometers have been used to measure and track steps as a representation of daily physical activity in children and adults beginning in the early 1990s (Bassett et al., 1996; Tryon, Pinto, and Morrison, 1991). Different types of pedometers have been used literature as various models and brands have been shown to be accurate and reliable. As an intervention tool, pedometers have been described as:

> “a tracking device (continuously collecting current activity), a feedback tool (providing immediate information on activity level), and as an environmental cue (reminder to be active). Used in combination with record keeping (e.g., calendars or diaries of daily progress), pedometers may be used in an effective way to increase daily physical activity.” (Tudor-Locke, 2002)

According to a systematic review, the use of pedometers was associated with an increase of 2,491 steps per day for adults engaged in randomized controlled trials, and 2,183 steps per day for adults enrolled in observational studies. Across all study types the authors also found that pedometer use was associated with significant reductions in body mass index (Bravata, Smith-Spangler, Sundaram, and al., 2007).

### Behavioral Self-Monitoring

> “People cannot influence their own motivations and actions very well if that cannot pay adequate attention to their own performance, the consequences under which they occur, and the immediate and distal effects they produce.” (Bandura, 1991, p. 250)

Behavioral self-monitoring, observing and recording one’s own behavior(s), has long been identified as a key piece of various theoretical models of behavior. Self-monitoring, originally designed as a method for obtaining data and insight about behavior which was only observable by the individual (and not by a therapist or interventionist) has also been identified as worthwhile intervention technique in health behavior program design and research. Self-monitoring is thought to be an effective method of engaging individuals in their health behavior because of reactive effects, evaluative effects, and it’s influence on self-regulatory mechanisms.

Self-monitoring has a rich history in the therapeutic and behavioral psychology literature. Self monitoring is effective for prompting behavior change and is used by over 80% of cognitive and behavioral therapists (Elliott, Miltenberger, Kaster-Bundgaard, and Lumley, 1996; Korotitsch1999; Olson and Winchester, 2008). Dating back to the 1970’s researchers and clinicians have been debating about how self-monitoring interacts with changes in human behavior. In the 1970s, Kanfer described self-monitoring as being composed of three distinct and ordered processes related to self-directed behavior change: self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-reinforcement or punishment. Self-monitoring is simply the act of observation and recording of the behavior of interest. Self-evaluation is the act of comparing the observed and recorded information against a self-selected criterion or goal. Lastly, self-reinforcement or punishment is the “motivational” component during which self-selected internal or external rewards are introduced (when observed behavior meets or exceed the criterion) or internal or external negative consequences are realized (i.e. punishment, when observed behavior does not meet the criterion (Kanfer, 1970).

In his work on developing Social Cognitive Theory, Albert Bandura emphasized the role of self-monitoring as a primary sub-function of self-regulatory processes. In contrast to the earlier characterization by Kanfer, Bandura describes self-monitoring as “not simply a mechanical audit of one’s performances.” In addition to the regulatory actions of criterion formation and evaluation, Bandura proposed additional domains in which we can understand how engaging in self-monitoring can impact behavior. These include, the self-diagnostic and self-motivating functions, temporal proximity, informativeness, motivational level, behavior valence, and orientation to self-monitoring (Bandura, 1991, p. 250). Bandura describes the cognitive self-regulatory processes of self-observation, judgment, and self-reaction, suggesting that interactions between these processes create the locus of self-regulated motivation. Bandura proposed that the locus of self-regulated motivation is observed discrepancies between current behavior and personal or social standards. Bandura also suggests that self-efficacy predicts cognitive self-regulation, and that reducing the discrepancies between current behaviors and personal or social standards can enhance self-efficacy. Physical activity tracking devices and applications generate motivating discrepancies and have the potential to improve self-efficacy through prominent features such as goal setting, feedback on the gaps between personal goals and current behaviors, and feedback comparing personal behavior to behavioral norms of social groups.

Self-monitoring has been shown to have an impact on behavior even when additional intervention methods or tools do not accompany it. For example, self-monitoring has been found to be an effect method for improving diet and weight, physical activity, and diabetes control. In fact, self-monitoring has been described as a “key strategy” for long-term weight loss by researches examining the behaviors of participants in the National Weight Control Registry. A meta-analysis of behavior change techniques for healthy eating and physical activity identified self-monitoring as the technique that explains the greatest amount of heterogeneity in the included studies, indicating it’s value and importance for improving effectiveness of health behavior interventions (Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, and Gupta, 2009). As with any measurement method, a premium is placed on accuracy. Korotitsch and Nelson-Gray (1999) identified nine variables that may affect the accuracy of the self-monitored data: 1) Awareness of accuracy checks, 2) Topography of the target behavior 3) Training, 4) Compliance, 5) Reinforcement, 6) Nature of the recording device, 7) Concurrent response requirements, 8) Valence of the target behavior and, 9) Timing of recordings. Furthermore, Korotitsch and Nelson-Gray identified several techniques that can increase compliance, such as verbal commitments, frequent prompts or reminders, and monetary incentives. Both compliance and accuracy affect the degree to which self-monitoring is effective for inducing behavior change. Olson et al. (2011) found that offering individuals a choice in target behavior, as opposed to prescribing a specific behavior, resulted in increased compliance with self-monitoring activities and self-reported levels of behavior change. Foster et al. (1999) also indicated that issues related to compliance with data collection, data quality, and the burden or participation in self-monitoring research are important areas of exploration in this field of study.

### The New Age of Self-Monitoring

In 2008, Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly held the first Quantified Self meetup where approximately 30 individuals gathered to share stories about how they were using technological methods and tools to track, measure, analyze, and understand their lives. In 2010 Wolf wrote what is consider the definite account of the creation and rational behind the Quantified Self phenomenon. In his article, he places the history of self-monitoring in historical and present context, noting that prior to recent changes most monitoring was done by hand and required using laborious methods to infer meaning.

> “Then four things changed. First, electronic sensors got smaller and better. Second, people started carrying powerful computing devices, typically disguised as mobile phones. Third, social media made it seem normal to share everything. And fourth, we began to get an inkling of the rise of a global superintelligence known as the cloud.” (Wolf, 2010)

These four changes to our personal interactions with technology have caused a wide-spread increase the availability and use of devices, applications, and tools that have quickly overtaken the “by hand” method of self-monitoring and self-collected data gathering. For instance there are over 60 wrist-worn devices that can track data related to physical activity including heart rate, skin temperature, and skin conductivity (Ramirez, 2014). Individuals can use their smart phones to track their location and activity at high fidelity by using applications that gather and process signals from the many onboard sensors (i.e. accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS). The popularity of self-tracking in and outside the physical activity domain has been increasing over time. In the 2013 report, Tracking for Health, the Pew Research Center’s Internet and Life Project found that nearly 70% of adults track at least one health indicator for themselves or others. Of those who track, 21% track with technology (Fox and Duggan, 2013). Generalizing those findings to the current US adult population would lead us to estimate that 34.5 million adults may be tracking their health using technologically mediated means. However, it should be noted that the actual number of individuals tracking for health and using a device, application, or digital tool to do so, is currently unknown.
