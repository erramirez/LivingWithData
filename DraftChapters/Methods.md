Methods

### Research Design.

This study was designed to elicit both qualitative and quantitative information from individuals who had been using a physical activity tracking device (Fitbit) for long period of time (>= 90 days). Participants recruited to participate in this research study were asked to complete two phases in order to participate in the study. In the initial phase participants who met the inclusion criteria and consented to be included in the study were asked to connect their Fitbit accounts to the Fitabase analytics system (Small Steps Labs, San Diego, CA, USA). This allowed participants to grant access to their historical data, collected through their Fitbit device, to the investigator. Once participants completed phase one they were asked to take part in a two-stage interview in-person, via phone, or via a web-video conference. Each interview was designed to last between 1.5 and 2 hours. The first stage of the interview consisted of gathering demographic data and completing various psychosocial measures. This lasted approximately 30 minutes. The second stage of the interview was a semi-structured interview and conversation with the pariticpant that covered a variety of topics related to the participants’ use of the Fitbit, the participants’ relationship with the data it collects, and the use of behavior change techniques. The institutional review board from the Univeristy of California, San Diego approved this study.

### Setting

As participants were able to complete both phases of the study remotely, this study was open to individuals living in the United States and abroad.

### Recruitment

Participants were recruited through a variety of web and personal channels. Recruitment materials (see appendix TK) that described the study were posted to the following locations:

-   Fitbit subreddit (available at <http://reddit.com/r/fitbit>)
-   Fitbit discussion forums (available at <https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Discussions/ct-p/discussions>)
-   Quantifiedself.com forums (available at <https://forum.quantifiedself.com>)
-   Quantified Self Facebook group (available at <https://www.facebook.com/groups/quantifiedself/>)

These online groups and websites are open to anyone and are used to announce events and opportunities, engage in open discussion, and coordinate group activities. The primary investigator posted under his own account or under an account labeled, "UCSDFitbitStudy". Snowball sampling was also used to recruit additional participants. At the conclusion of the interview participants were asked to recommend study participation to individuals who are listed in their “Fitbit Friends” network and additional friends or family who meet the inclusion criteria. Additional copies of of the recruitment materials were provided to participants who expressed interest in sharing the study with others. All recruitment materials prompted individuals to contact the primary investigator via email (<erramirez@ucsd.edu>) if they were interested in participating. The primary investigator replied to all individuals who expressed interest with additional information about the study and a prompt to schedule a brief (10 to 15 minute) screening phone call. If the individual met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (described below) they were provided a copy of the informed consent and the study methods were described in detail. If the individual consented to be a participant in the study they were prompted to schedule an interview with the primary investigator and were given detailed instructions on how to connect their Fitbit account to the Fitabase analytics system.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Inclusion and exclusion criteria consisted of: 1) men and women between 18 and 60 years old, 2) current user of a Fitbit activity tracking device, 3) a minumum of 90 days of use of any combination of Fibit activity tracking devices, 4) the ability to use video teleconferencing systems (e.g. Skype, Google Hangout, Facetime), 5) willing and able authorize the primary investigator to access and download a copy of Fitbit data via the Fitabase analytics system, 6) no more than six (20% of total sample size) particiapnts who identify as early adopters of self-tracking practices as derived from their membership in Quantified Self meetup groups or online communities. Participants were not excluded based on ethnic background, location, or health status.

Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures
--------------------------------------

### Historical Fitbit Data / Fitabase

A research project was created in the Fitbase analytics system in order to send authorization requests and collect historical Fitbit data from consented participants. A data authorization page (appendix TK) that included information about the data collection process was created. This authorization page was emailed to each participant after their eligibility was confirmed and they consented to participation in the study. The authorization page contained a "data connection" button, which when pressed, allowed participants to authorize Fitabase to access and store their historical Fitbit data. No personal login information (email or login password associated with the participant's Fitbit account) was passed to the investigator or Fitabase during the authorization process. When a participant successfully authorized Fitabase to connect to their Fitbit account the data collection process begins. Fitbase uses the Fitbit API to request all historical data associated with an individual's Fitbit account


Participants were asked to connect their Fitbit account to the Fitabase analytics system via email. A data authorization page (appendix TK) was created


In this second phase, Fitbit data, collected by the recruited participants, will be accessed and downloaded in order to complete a quantitative analysis to compliment the research conducted in phase one. Fitbit data (daily aggregate and 1-minute intraday data) from each participant will be gathered and stored for the duration of the study. In order to understand the behavioral characteristics of the participants, all historical activity tracker data will also be made available for analysis. That is to say, once the participants consent to participate in this research project and authorize their Fitbit data to be read, their complete Fitbit data history will be collected. Data analysis will include comparisons to participants’ answers as well as comparisons to national guidelines, exploration of behavioral patterns, and classifications based on the full dataset provided by all participants.

### Demographic Information.

Participants completed a demographic questionnaire that includes birth year, gender, race/ethnicity, education, height, weight, marital status, and household income.

### 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR)

The 7-DAY PAR is a validated, interview-administered, semi-structured physical activity recall survey (J. F. Sallis et al., 1985). Participants will be asked to recall their physical activity behaviors and intensities for the previous seven days.

### Psychosocial Survey

The participant were asked to complete a psychosocial survey designed to identify various aspects of physical activity behavior and thought processes. These measures, designed and validated for use with adult men and women include short surveys to determine decisional balance, self-efficacy, behavior change strategies, and social support related to physical activity behavior (Carlson et al., 2012).

### Interview

A short and evolving set of interview questions was be prepared for each interview and updated to reflect our emerging understanding as the research progresses (the initial set of interview questions is included in this application). This phase is intended to uncover the narratives and processes that reflect the realty of using a physical activity tracker. An Informed Grounded Theory approach will be used to transcribe, code, and identify themes from the interviews. This approach is based on the use of prior research and literature to inform and focus attention on specific ideas or concepts during the qualitative research process (Thornberg, 2012). By using prior research in the area of behavior change as well as findings from similarly designed studies, this process may build on the existing knowledge in this area while simultaneously being open to the identification of new and unique themes and phenomena related to physical activity tracker use.
