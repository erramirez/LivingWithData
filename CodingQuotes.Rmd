P10: It tells me, with enough trust, the truth about what I'm doing.

p9: I feel like it's more seeing the positives than the hassle of walking, which I don't see as a hassle any more. I think that is because of Fitbit.

p9: Lots of other things changed in my life. At the same time I feel like, over time, even just wearing an exercise tracking device on your wrist every day, it makes you think about it a lot.
Even if I hadn't made the change yet, it just makes me think about it more than I would and reminds me, "Yes, [Margaret], this is something you care about."

p7: People always say, "Oh, sitting is really bad for your health." I was, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. I should get up and walk more. Definitely got to walk. Yeah, I should get a treadmill desk. I have nowhere to put it, but yeah, yeah." It was the Fitbit that actually made the difference.

p2: At my job, we invest in companies. If you ask me for stats and facts about one of the companies we invested in, I could give you way more stats and facts about one of those companies than I could about myself. It seems inherently wrong.

p5: I've definitely learned that I do not take as many steps as I thought I did before having a Fitbit. I remember being really confident when I first got my Fitbit, because I was a teacher so I was like, "Great. I'm not sitting at my cubicle all day. I'm up in the classroom, standing in front of kids, walking around the classroom.
I'm going to have crazy numbers. I'm going to be killing it with all friends and family. I'm a teacher, you know? This will be great."
I think after looking at the data such as at the first couple of months that I had a Fitbit, it was a shock that unless you're going to the gym. Your numbers are not very high just on walking to the car, and walking into a classroom, and moving around a campus, and getting back home.
It's really not a lot of steps for the entire day. I think that probably really surprised me the most, that you really have to be focused on the movement, and you have to have a purpose.

p9: I am a big believer of the value in data for understanding yourself and the world better.

p10: It's funny to think about the role, your Fitbit plays. It's more just a supportive thing. It's there if I'm wearing it. It tells me, with enough trust, the truth about what I'm doing.

p11: But knowing that having a source of data that you're looking at is motivating. Just measure it, just the act of having a system to track and measure and building awareness of that information, changes behavior without question.

p20: It's like a game. It's like you're getting credit for something. A lot of exercise, aside from your actual weight, it's not always tangible. Being able to look at my records and see how I improved in this area or that area is something that's...I'm a stats guy, so those kinds of things appeal to me.

 p20: Yeah, definitely. It's at least a reminder. I think about it. Every time I see my Fitbit, I think of my activity. I associate it with it. I definitely love having it on, like I feel a little bit upset, honestly, when I realize that I left it at home whenever I do leave it at home.

#### about creating mental models of what counts for steps ####
p22: Just looking at the steps, and then sometimes if it's super low, I'll be like, "Oh, let's go walk around the building." I'll take one lap around the building, but it's only 500 steps, so I'm like, "Ugh, let's take two laps then," because I've mapped out different routes around my office, and I'll know how many steps it is from point A to point B, just so I can up that number.
Interviewer:  Got you. How long did it take you to figure that out?
P22:  When we moved into this building I had that figured out within about a couple of weeks.


p25: I feel a sense of pride when I look at it. I'm like, "Yeah, I did that," and now it's in the books.

p25: We'll usually start with, "Are you gyming tonight?" I'll be like, "Man, I have to. I need more steps."

P7: I've had that for years, and I always ignore it. It comes up and says, "Time for you to break," and I go, "Yeah, yeah." I hit dismiss. I've been doing that for years. There's always been that knowledge that I need to get up and move [laughs] .
But when I'm working there's the tune like, "I'm working. I can't stop now, because I'm working." I dismiss it, but with the Fitbit I was thinking, "Oh, I wonder if it will make me get up and move more," and it did.

P9: For now, it's more just when I'm walking around and probably not driving. Driving is the enemy of walking.

p12: Going for a walk, especially when I first got the Fitbit I'd do the classics, walk around my apartment and set goals until I reached 10,000. *in response to doing things to mee their goal at the end of the day*

p13:  I think I appreciate walking more. It wasn't something that I considered before having the Fitbit, but now that I have it. I do take it more seriously and fit it more into my daily routine.
